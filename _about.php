		<p class="lead">e-RA provides a permanent managed database for secure
			storage of data from Rothamsted's Long-term Experiments, the oldest,
			continuous agronomic experiments in the world. Together with the
			accompanying meteorological records, associated documentation and
			sample archive, it is a unique historical record of experiments that
			have been measured continuously for over 170 years.</p>

			</li>
			<li><b>Weather Data:</b> Daily meteorological data is recorded at
				three of the Rothamsted Research sites, Rothamsted, Woburn and
				Brooms Barn. We provide here all the information on how it is
				recorded, the actual data (available through e-RAdata), some more
