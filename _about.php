		<p class="lead">e-RA provides a permanent managed database for secure
			storage of data from Rothamsted's Long-term Experiments, the oldest,
			continuous agronomic experiments in the world. Together with the
			accompanying meteorological records, associated documentation and
			sample archive, it is a unique historical record of experiments that
			have been measured continuously since 1843. </p>

			<li><b>Sites:</b> Rothamsted Research has experimental arable farms across four sites in England, the
				original and most important is at Rothamsted, Harpenden (since 1843),
				with others at Woburn (since 1876), Brooms Barn (since 1962) and Saxmundham (1965-2010).
			</li>
			<li><b>Experiments:</b> Lists the main long-term experiments, grouped
				by research farm. Each experiment is described extensively and has a list
				of all the collated datasets currently available for it, supporting documentation, site details, history
				and images.
			</li>
			<li><b>Datasets: </b>The Open Access Datasets (OADs) currently available for the long-term experiments. We include
				advice on copyright, appropriate credits, data quality and how to access the two different types of
				datasets. New prepared datasets are announced on Twitter.</li>


			<li><b>Meteorological Data:</b> Daily meteorological data is recorded at
				three of the Rothamsted Research sites: Rothamsted, Woburn and
				Brooms Barn. Summary data is available for Saxmundham. This section provides information on the
				available collated datasets plus data collection and processing methods, advice on copyright,
				appropriate credits, data quality and how to access the three different types of datasets. We also
				provide educational activities and datasets for schools.
			<li><b>About:</b> Information on the e-RA project, who to

	<div class="row mx-3 px-3">
		<ul>
<li><b>Open Access Datasets (OADs):</b>  Data directly downloadable with accompanying metadata, no password required. </li>
			<p><u>Summary Open Access Datasets (Summary OADs)</u> - Provide averaged or selected data with some accompanying metadata and descriptions. These provide a summary overview of key data, findings, trends, or changes in the data averaged across a restricted number of plots and/or years. Both LTE and met data are in this format. Meteorological (met) data present daily data averaged to monthly or annual values.</p>
			<p><u>Complete Open Access Datasets (Complete OADs) </u>- 'Frictionless' format providing comprehensive data with full metadata contained in file. These provide all plots and years relating to a distinct period of time in an LTE, in a machine-readable format with treatments, agronomic information and yields provided. Currently only LTE data is provided in this format.,</p>
			<li><b>e-RAdata: </b>This database  (previously the Data Extraction Tool, DET) provides the daily meteorological data. It also contains original LTE data, no
				accompanying metadata. It requires registration for a password.			</li>
