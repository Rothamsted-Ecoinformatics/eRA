The experiment is duplicated at Woburn on a contrasting sandy loam soil.\n\nMaize and spring barley were chosen as crops with contrasting delta 13C enrichment in their residues. This can be used to follow the fate of the C incorporated in the crop residues. The experiments were established initially for use in SOM fractionation studies, but staff and analytical funds are no longer available to support this work, so the experiment was discontinued in 2015.",
