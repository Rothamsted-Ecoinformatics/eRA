        "description": "The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on the yields of a sequence of arable crops, on a sandy loam soil at Woburn Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. Mg, Mn and S were tested on split plots at different times. Target soil pH was 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. There was a parallel experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Farm. The experiment was discontinued in 1997.",
