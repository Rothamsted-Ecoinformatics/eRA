				<p>EML state that the "ARG100 rain gauge typically captures over 5% more rainfall than most 
				traditionally-shaped cylindrical gauges due to its unique aerodynamic shape and reduced evaporation-loss properties". 
				This has been found to be the case at Rothamsted, were rainfall in the 5" rain gauge continued to be measured on a twice

					<p>"Missing values" There are some instances before 1968 when no data is shown for <b>RAIN</b> (rather than zero). 
					This is because a 'trace' of rain, snow, mist, dew or fog was manually recorded. A 'trace' is less than 0.05mm.
