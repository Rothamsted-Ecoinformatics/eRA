            "description": "The pH of the soil (at depth 0-23cm) on Park Grass was approximately 5.5 (in water) when the experiment began. The effects of small amounts of liming with chalk were tested in the 1880s. A regular test of liming began in 1903 with chalk applied every 4 years to the southern half of most plots. From 1965, the plots were further divided: two quarters of the previously limed half receive amounts of chalk calculated to maintain pH at 7 (sub plot a) and 6 (sub plot b); one part of the formerly un-limed half receives chalk, where necessary, to maintain pH 5 (sub plot c), and the other quarter (sub plot d) remains un-limed.\r\n\r\nExcept where sodium nitrate (orange line N*) has been applied or where liming with chalk has maintained the pH (dashed lines), soil has acidified slowly through the impact of acid deposition from the atmosphere and rapidly where ammonium fertiliser (blue line N) has been applied. Soil pH (0-23cm) is c 3.5 on the plots given most ammonium sulphate and 5.0-5.3 on the un-limed, unfertilized plots. Sub plot c of most plots is nearest to the original soil pH. Soil pH has slowly recovered by about 0.5 pH units on plot 9/1d (data not shown), more than 25 years after ammonium sulphate was last applied."

            "description": "In 1965 most plots were divided into four sub-plots. Three subplots receive different amounts of lime as required to maintain pH at 7, 6 and 5 (sub-plots a, b and c, respectively). Sub-plot d receives no lime and pH of these ranges from 3.5 to 5.7, depending on the fertilizer treatment.\r\n\r\npH was first measured in 1876 by glass electrode method (1:2.5 soil:water; in the topsoil (0-23cm) and subsoil (23-46cm)), then  by Crowther in 1923 using the hydrogen electrode method and a 1:5 soil:water suspension. The next measurements were made on samples from 1959, using a glass electrode and a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension (Warren and Johnston, 1964). The different soil:water ratios had little effect on measured pH (see Warren and Johnston 1963, p 244-245). Further samples were taken in 1976 (0-23cm only) and 1984 and the pH of these soils, together with stored soils from 1876, was determined by the same method as used in 1959."
