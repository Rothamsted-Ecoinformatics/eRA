<h1>Park Grass Botanical Compostion</h1>
<p>
	Studies have also been made of the botanical composition of the plots
	both through visual surveys and by looking at the percentage
	contribution to the hay made by the various species. The most recent
	comprehensive surveys of botanical composition, <b>PARKCOMPIC</b>, made
	just before the first cut, were done annually between 1991 and 2000.
	See <a HREF="https://doi.org/10.23637/ERADOC-1-253" target="_blank">150th
		Anniversary Publication </a> for soil pH and a summary of those species
	comprising at least 10% of herbage, and the total number of species
	identified on each plot (after Crawley et al, 2005). There are many
	interactions between fertilizer, manure treatment and pH. Without
	exception, all the original treatments imposed in 1856 have caused a
	decline in species number compared to the original sward. In most
	cases, this is due to changes in soil fertility and annual nutrient
	inputs and perhaps also the way in which the sward was managed. Numbers
	of species have decreased, even on the plots given no fertilizers or
	manures, due to acid deposition. Applying nitrogen as sodium nitrate or
	ammonion sulphate reduces diversity further, and in the ammonium form
	also rapidly acidifies the soil, reducing the number of species to one
	or two, <i>Holcus lanatus</i> (Yorkshire Fog) and <i>Anthoxanthum
		odoratum</i> (Sweet Vernal Grass).

	<b>Survey method: </b>From 1991 to 2000, six randomly located quadrats
	measuring 50cm x 25cm were located within each of the plots in early
	June, immediately before the first cut. The herbage was cut with
	scissors to ground level and plant material taken back to the
	laboratory where it was sorted into species. Samples were oven-dried at
	80 Â°C for 24 hours, after which dry mass was determined for each
	species. Data in <b>PARKCOMPIC</b> is shown as gm/0.125 m<sup>2</sup>
	for each quadrat and as gm/0.75m<sup>2</sup> for the total (ie 6
	quadrats).

	The dataset <b>PKMASSEFF</b> is a survey of plant diversity carried out
	by <b>Kunin</b> (1998) in 1993 and 1994. He measured plant diversity in
	54 transects across the plot boundaries of all plots, except 5, 9-1,
	14-1, 18-20, mainly sub-plots 'a' (pH = 7) and 'd' (unlimed). Transects
	were surveyed in May and June 1993 and May 1994, before the first cut
	of each year. In each surveyed transect the number of reproductive
	plants of each species was recorded. See Kunin (1998) in Key References
	below for full details of survey method and description of transects.

	<b>Earlier surveys</b> of the botanical composition of Park Grass were
	carried out from 1862 to 1976. The dataset <b>PARKCOMP</b> consists of
	complete botanical analyses, carried out in 1862, 1867, 1872 and 1877,
	and several more times between 1903 and 1948. No analyses were carried
	out between 1949 and 1972. Further full botanical analyses were carried
	out on limited plots between 1973 and 1976. Full details are given by
	Williams 1978. Samples of plant material were taken from each plot,
	separated into the different species and weighed. The Open University
	two letter species codes are also included.
</p>

<p>
	The dataset <b>PARKPARTCOMP</b> contains a much simpler partial
	analysis of the three main groups of plants - grasses, legumes and
	other species. These were carried out between 1862 and 1976. Again
	samples were taken from each plot, separated and then weighed to
	determine the percentage composition.
</p>

<p>Except during 1895-1902, either complete or partial analyses were
	done in all years between 1874 and 1948 for plots 3 (unmanured), 7
	(PKNaMg) and 9 (N2PKNaMg). Full details are given by Williams 1978.</p>

<p>
	Williams (1978) analysed selected plots between 1973 and 1976, after
	the sub-division of the Limed (L) and Unlimed (U) plots into a, b, c
	and d sub-plots. Results for 1975 and 1976 in <b>PARKPARTCOMP</b> still
	refer to L and U half-plots. The L half-plot is equivalent to the a and
	b sub-plots, the U half-plot is equivalent to the c and d subplots.
</p>

<p>
	Between 1920 and 1990 visual surveys were made twice a year, before the
	hay was cut in June and again in the autumn (<b>PARKVISUAL</b>).
