            "design_description": "In 1965 most plots were divided into four sub-plots, three of which receive chalk to maintain pHs of 7, 6 and 5 (sub-plots a, b and c respectively). The fourth sub-plot (sub-plot d) receives no chalk and the pH of these ranges from 3.5 to 5.7 depending on the fertilizer treatment.\nFrom 1965 plots 5/1, 5/2 and 6 were used for microplot experiments. Plots 6a and 6b were re-included in the main experiment in 1972 but the other half of plot 6 (6c and 6d) and plots 5/1 and 5/2 have remained outside the main experiment. Since 1990, nitrogen fertilizer has been withheld from half of all sub-plots formerly receiving 96 kg N ha-1 (plots 9 and 14) as either ammonium sulphate or sodium nitrate to study processes controlling soil acidification, heavy-metal mobilisation and botanical changes. Since 1995, plot 13 has been split into 13/1 and 13/2 and FYM/Fishmeal withheld from plot 13/1. Since 1996 plot 2 has been split into 2/1 and 2/2 with plot 2/1 receiving K as potassium sulphate.\nIn 2013 plot 7 (PKNaMg) was divided into two equal sized plots, 7/1 and 7/2. This was to test whether P fertilizer was still required, because large reserves of P have built up in the soil. No P fertilizer was applied to Plot 7/1, but K, Na and Mg applications continued. Plot 7/2 continued as before (i.e. it received PKNaMg). In addition, N applications began on plot 15; 144kg N/ha as sodium nitrate to provide a comparison with plot 11/1 which receives the same amount of N as ammonium sulphate together with P, K, Na & Mg.\nFrom autumn 2016 all plots previously receiving 35 kg P ha-1 as triple superphosphate will receive 17 kg P ha-1 (until further notice) because of the high levels of available soil P from past P inputs. The P application to plot 20 will remain unchanged. Current K, Mg and Na rates on Park Grass remain unchanged.",

    "description": "Started by Lawes and Gilbert in 1856, its original purpose was to investigate ways of improving the yield of hay by the application of inorganic fertilisers or organic manures. \nWithin 2-3 years it became clear that these treatments were having a dramatic effect on the species composition of what had been a uniform sward comprising about 50 species. Dramatically different swards have evolved as a result of the different pH and nutrient status of the soils. There are 35-45 species on the unfertilised plots but only 2 or 3 species on some of the fertilised plots. The continuing effects on species diversity and on soil function of the original treatments, together with later tests of liming and interactions with atmospheric inputs and climate change, has meant that Park Grass has become increasingly important to ecologists and soil scientist.\nThe plots are cut for hay in mid-June. The first cut for hay ensures seeds are returned each year. The management of the aftermath following the first hay cut varied in the early years, either being grazed by sheep or cut green. Since the 1890s the second crop has been cut green and removed. In some years a third cut has also been taken\nThe experiment includes a small area used for micro-plot experiments.",
