        "description": "Details of the lime or chalk applied to the Park Grass permanent grassland experiment since the start of the experiment in 1856. Small amounts of ground chalk were applied to all plots in the 1880s and 1890s. A regular test of liming was started in 1903 when most plots were divided into two and lime applied every four years to one half. In 1965 a new liming scheme was started. Plots were divided into four sub-plots with ground chalk applied to maintain soil at pH 7, 6, and 5 on the \u2018a\u2019, \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 sub-plots. The \u2018d\u2019 sub-plot receives no lime.",
