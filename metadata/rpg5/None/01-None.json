All/selected [delte as necessary] treatments plots and sub-plots are provided. Variations in yield reflect the various treatments and liming regimes."

            "description": "Since 1960, yields of dry matter have been estimated from strips cut with a forage harvester. However, for the first cut the remainder of each plot is still mown and made into hay, continuing earlier management and ensuring return of seed. For the second cut, the whole of each plot is cut with a forage harvester. Consequently recorded yields of dry matter are now larger than previously as fewer losses occur."
