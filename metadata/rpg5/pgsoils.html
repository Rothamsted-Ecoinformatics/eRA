<H2>Park Grass Soils</H2>
<p>The Park Grass experiment was started by Lawes and Gilbert in
	1856 to look at the effects of applying fertilizers and manures on the
	yield of hay from permanent grassland. The field had been in permanent
	pasture for at least 100 years before the experiment began. It is never
	ploughed or sown. Here, details are given of the site and soil.</p>

	<b>Soil texture class: </b> Silty clay loam over clay-with-flints
	overlying chalk. The site is normally well drained (Hook series) or
	moderately well drained (Batcombe series) (Avery & Catt, 1995).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil texture,</b> 0-23cm, 2002 from six sub-plots (Poulton, <i>pers
		comm</i>):
</p>
<ul>

	<li>Sand (2000 - 63 &micro;m) : 11.6 %</li>
	<li>Silt (63 - 2 &micro;m) : 66.3 %</li>
	<li>Clay (&lt;2 &micro;m) : 22.1 %</li>

<p>
	<b>Soil structure: </b> The structure of the topsoils are clearly
	influenced by organic matter content and base status. The calcareous
	plots have very dark coloured surface horizons, characterized by
	strongly developed granular or fine subangluar blocky peds. In
	contrast, the acid plots are more weakly structured and in extreme
	cases, typified by the unlimed plots which have received regular
	applications of ammonium sulphate (eg plots 4/2d, 9/2d and 11/2d),
	organic matter has accumulated at the surface to form a discrete mat or
	mor layer, and the immediately underlying mineral soil is massive and
	structureless (Avery & Catt, 1995).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil pH: </b> In 1965 most plots were divided into four sub-plots.
	Three subplots receive different amounts of lime as required to
	maintain pH at 7, 6 and 5 (sub-plots a, b and c, respectively).
	Sub-plot d receives no lime and pH of these ranges from 3.5 to 5.7,
	depending on the fertilizer treatment. See <a
		href="http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/dataset/rpg5/01-OAPGsoilpH"> Park Grass Open Access soil pH</a> for selected
	plots, for more details.
</p>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil sampling: </b> A few plots were sampled in 1870 but the first
	major soil sampling was in 1876, 20 years after the experiment started.
	Soils were taken with an open-ended iron box, 30.5cm x 30.5cm x 22.9cm
	deep. Just three samples were taken from each plot, as this method was
	disruptive on grassland. Since 1932, samples have been taken by
	straight-sided semi-cylindrical auger, bulking a large number of cores
	for each plot or sub-plot. All samples except in 1932 have been taken
	to a depth of 23cm, and in some years, deeper samples were also taken
	(Poulton, 1996).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil bulk density: </b> A standard value of 1.1 g cm<sup>3</sup>
	(2500 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) should be used as a general indication of soil
	bulk density. This is the mean of all plots, sampled in 2011, 0-23cm
	only. Note that if detailed plot calculations are required, eg nutrient
	content, individual plot data should be used - please contact the <a
		href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators </a> for this. Also, in
	some plots bulk density varies greatly within the 23cm depth
	particularly on acidic sub-plots with a 'mat' of semi decomposed
	organic matter on the surface.
