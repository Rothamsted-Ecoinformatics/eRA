<h2>Harvesting methods</h2>

<p>The plots were originally cut by scythe, then by horse-drawn and
	then tractor-drawn mowers. The mowing maching was first used for the
	first cut in 1901, though it had been used for the second cut since
	1881. The plots were cut each year for hay, usually in June, and a
	second cut taken in the autumn since 1875. A second cut was not taken
	every year, and not from every plot each year, if there was
	insufficient herbage to sample. No second cut taken 1856-1874, 1876,
	1884, 1885, 1887, 1899, 1911, 1914, 1921, 1924, 1933 or 2003. In
	1903-1917, the second cut was taken from the whole plot, not the Limed
	and Unlimed halves. The regrowth after the first cut was grazed by
	sheep 1856-1872, except for 1866, 1870, and 1873 and 1874, when the
	regrowth was mown but not removed from the plots.</p>

<p>Yields were originally estimated by weighing the produce from the
	whole plot, either as hay (1st harvest) or green crop (2nd harvest),
	and dry matter determined. Since 1960, yields of dry matter have been
	estimated from strips cut with a forage harvester. However, for the
	first cut the remainder of each plot is still mown and made into hay,
	continuing earlier management and ensuring return of seed. For the
	second cut, the whole of each plot is cut with a forage harvester.
	Consequently recorded yields of dry matter are now larger than
	previously as fewer losses occur. The following correction factor
	should be used for post-1960 data for cut 1 to give yield values
	equivalent to pre-1960 values:</p>
<p>
	Y<sub>cut 1</sub> = 0.2743 x (Y<sub>F</sub> <sup>1.662</sup> ) (Bowley
	et al, 2017)
</p>


<p>
	where Y<sub>F</sub> = yield collected by forage harvester, t/ha. The
	correction factor was obtained from the relationship between yields for
	hay and forage harvested cuts (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) for a selection of
	plots for 1959 and 1992-1994. For more details, refer to Bowley et al,
	2017 (see <a href="/Park#papers">Key References</a> below).
</P>
<p>Since 2021, a new machine has been in use, the 'Amazone Forage Harvester'. It cuts a width of 1.5m rather than the previous 1.1m. The machine is fitted with a bespoke weighing balance which weighs the cut as it goes. Subsequent analyses  take this into  account and a conversion is already calculated.</P>
