Details of the fertilizer, lime treatments and harvest dates are also included. In 1965, a new liming regime was introduced with four sub-plots per plot (a. at pH 7, b. at pH 6, c. at pH 5 and d. un-limed). Yields are provided for all fertiliser treatment plots and sub-plots (except for plots 5 and 6 cd, which were used for micro-plot experiments). Yields are expressed as t/ha at 100% dry matter. Variations in yield reflect the various fertilizer treatments and liming regimes, as well as the local weather and atmospheric inputs."

See Third Design Period 1965- for detail. The yields  are estimated from strips cut from the centre of each plot  with a forage harvester (since 1960). After the first cut in mid-June the remainder of each plot is mown and made into hay, continuing earlier management and ensuring return of seed. For the second cut, the whole of each plot is cut with a forage harvester."

            "description": "Park Grass was initiated to investigate the ways of improving the yield of hay by the application of inorganic fertilizers and organic manure. With time, the soil became more acidic and in 1903 plots had been halved and the effects of lime tested. From 1965 a new liming regime was initiated with four sub-plots, three receiving lime to maintain soil pH (0-23cm depth) at pH 7, 6, and 5 on sub-plots a, b and c. Sub-plot d does not receive any lime.\r\nThe change in harvest method in 1960 means recorded yields of dry matter are larger than previously as fewer losses occur. The previous harvest method estimated yield by weighing the produce from the whole field. See reference by Bowley et al (2017)."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate. Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets."
