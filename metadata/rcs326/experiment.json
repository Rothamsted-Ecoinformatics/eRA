        "description": "This experiment, along with the Woburn Amounts of Straw experiment provides a comparison of soil organic matter dynamics in contrasting soil types, at Rothamsted (a silty clay loam) and at Woburn (a sandy loam). The experiments have been used to study soil structure and earthworm activity.\nThe findings at Rothamsted can be compared with those from section 0 on Broadbalk where straw is also incorporated.\nThe experiment was discontinued after the 2017 harvest. No yields were recorded in 2016 and 2017.",
