The effect of these four 'treatments' was compared on the yield of two arable 'test' crops. On the other plots the ley and arable 'treatment' crops alternated (called the Alternating rotations). A test of FYM applied to the first test crop was also included on one of each pair of main plots, 1938-1966. The test crops were potatoes followed by spring barley. Sugar beet replaced potatoes in 1956. Sainfoin replaced lucerne in 1965.",

    "description": "Started in 1938 to compare the effects of rotations with or without grass or grass-clover leys on the yield of two arable test crops. It is now an important resource for investigation long-term changes in SOM due to different cropping systems. Five year rotation of three years in arable crops or leys (short-term grassland) followed by two years of arable test crops. Total of 40 pairs of plots divided into 5 blocks,  phased-in over a five-year period, so the each year of the rotation is present each year.",
