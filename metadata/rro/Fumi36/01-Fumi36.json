N per acre, applied in 1936. \r\nBasal Manuring: Nil.\r\nCultivations, etc: Ploughed: Aug. 27-29 and Feb. 10-March 13. Spring-tine harrowed: March 19. Rolled, harrowed, sulphate of ammonia applied and drilled; March 20.. Harrowed: May 8. Rolled: May 9. Harvested: Aug. 7. Variety: Marvellous. Previous crop: Oats. (See 1935 Report, p. 176).\r\nSpecial Note: The entire produce was weighed, Oats plus weeds. Weight of oats was determined by sampling a strip 30 lks. X 1 yd. Third cysts count; Dec. 1 and 2. Two random samples of about 50 grms. of soil were taken per half plot.\r\nStandard Errors per plot: Weeds: 22.4 cwt. per acre or 19.8%. 3rd cyst count: sampling error 32.3 or 16.6%; experimental error 59.9 or 30.7%."
