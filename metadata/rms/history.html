	<h2>History of the measurement of meteorological data at Rothamsted</h2>

	<p>Meteorological data has been measured at Rothamsted's Harpenden site since 1853. The earliest 
	records are of rainfall and wind direction. Rainfall was originally recorded in a 5 inch (12.7cm) rain 
	gauge in the garden of Rivers Lodge, a house next door to the Rothamsted Russell Building.  
		The water collected was carried across to 
	the laboratory and measured in a graduated cylinder. The gauge was moved to the meteorological enclosure in Barnfield in around 1880. </p>
	<P>Thomas Wilson of Rivers Lodge was recording weather from at 
		least 1873. In August 1876, he offered to 'keep a Meteorological
		register' for the Met. Office. There is, as far as we know, a
		continuous record from then until 1899. He undoubtedly submitted the
		vast majority of these returns but as he often failed to sign them it
		is possible that someone else (most likely Edwin Grey) was responsible
		for some of the later ones; the last one that Wilson signed was, we
		think, that for January 1897. The Rothamsted Archive has Wilson's
		original records (MET3.1) because he asked the Met. Office to return
		them after copying the figures. He inconsistently gave the location as
		Harpenden, Harpenden Common or Rivers Lodge but never (or, perhaps,
		very seldom) wrote Rothamsted.</p>
	<p>Wilson made various observations (at Rivers Lodge) including
		temperature but his rainfall figures are from Rothamsted (i.e. the
		Barnfield site). This is not always specified but there are more than
		enough references to the fact to leave no doubt that this was
		invariably true.</p>
	<p>Data from the Rothamsted rain and drain gauges are in MET2.2.
		From January 1878, the tables also record minimum and maximum
		temperatures, which are from Rivers Lodge. Again this is not always
		specified but it is indicated sufficiently frequently to be sure that
		it was invariably so. We checked figures for November 1884 in the two
		documents ( i.e. Wilson's return to the Met. Office and the Rothamsted
		rain and drain gauge tables) and confirmed that, for both rainfall and
		temperature, they are identical. It is likely that the temperature
		data in e-RA were copied from MET2.2 because both start on 1st January
		1878; if the source was Wilson's original returns, the transcriber(s)
		would have been aware that the records started in August 1876.</p>
	<p>There is potential to extend back by seventeen months the daily
		maximum and minimum temperatures in e-RA but it would be wise to first
		examine in more detail the correspondence in MET4.2, which is thought
		to make reference to the acquisition of a screen; it's possible that
		Wilson did not, at first, have a screen. As Wilson's figures also
		include wet and dry bulb temperatures there is even greater scope to
		add to the humidity data in e-RA, which currently start in 1915.</p>

	<p>What happened after 1899 has not been established but nothing
		has been found to suggest that Wilson continued making returns to the
		Met. Office after that date. It is, however, almost certain that it
		was still Rivers Lodge data that were being submitted to them because
		Edwin Grey stated (in his 'Reminiscences'): 'The present collection of
		meteorological instruments now in use were obtained and set up in
		their present position by Sir Daniel Hall. Before these were acquired
		we used the records of Mr. Wilson's private instruments, the
		thermometer screen being in the grounds of River's (sic) Lodge and the
		barometer in the hall'. Hall came in 1902 and left in 1912 so,
		assuming that 'the present collection of meteorological instruments'
		to which Grey refers was on the Barnfield Met. Site, they can't have
		been in use before 1902. MET5.5 contains Edwin Grey's notebooks of
		'Daily Meteorological Records' 1891-4 and, perhaps more significantly,
		1897-1910; figures for the years up to 1902 can be assumed to be for
		Rivers Lodge even if that is not explicitly stated. We have found
		nothing to indicate when the Barnfield instruments were installed but,
		interestingly, there are in MET5.6, 'River's (sic) Lodge
		meteorological records, 1910-27'. Thus the Rivers Lodge instruments
		were being read until at least 1927, thus implying that observations
		were for some years being made on both sites (i.e. Rivers Lodge and
		Barnfield). It is, therefore, possible that, for some time after the
		new instruments had been installed on the Barnfield site, it was still
		Rivers Lodge data that were being sent to the Met. Office.</p>
