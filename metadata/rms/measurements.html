							</B> has been measured by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge of
							25.4cm (10 inch) diameter, (Campbell Scientific, ARG100)
							calibrated to tip at 0.2mm, within the original turf wall. The
							old 5 inch manual copper rain gauge is still used to manually
							measure precipitation fallen as snow when the tipping bucket rain
							gauge is blocked with snow or ice.
						</p>

						<p>
							<B>RAIN </B> was originally recorded in a 5 inch (12.7cm)
							diameter rain gauge built in a garden near the laboratory in
							1852. The water collected was measured in a graduated cylinder
							until about 1880. The gauge was then moved to the current
							meteorological enclosure. In 1948, a 5 inch (12.7cm) copper rain
							gauge of Meteorological Office standard was installed within a
							0.3 m high, 1.5 m radius turf wall retained by brick to reduce
							wind eddies.
						</p>

						<p>
							Data is available for <b>RAIN</b> from 05/02/1853 - present,
							except between 1880-1914. It is recommended that for a complete
							run of data from a standard rain gauge that a composite of RAIN
							and <b>RAIN5</b> is used, based on RAIN, with data from RAIN5
							being used from 1880-1914 only.
						</p>


						<p>"Missing values" There are many instances before 2004 when
							no data is shown for RAIN (rather than zero). This is because a
							'trace' of rain, snow, mist, dew or fog was manually recorded. A
							'trace' is less than 0.05mm. For most purposes a missing value
							can be assumed to be zero.</p>
						<p>
							The manufacturers of the ARG100 state that the "ARG100 rain gauge
							typically captures over 5% more rainfall than most
							traditionally-shaped cylindrical gauges due to its unique
							aerodynamic shape and reduced evaporation-loss properties". This
							has found to be the case at Rothamsed. A review of the
							differences in rainfall capture between the ARG100 and the manual
							5 inch gauge at Rothamsted was conducted. Using a double mass
							curve analysis, annual data from 1990-2017, and looking at each
							added year from 2004 (when the ARG100 was introduced), the
							overall correction factor is 1.1 or 10%. This means that the
							ARG100 captures 10% more rainfall than the manual 5 inch gauge.
							This correction is only applicable to annual and monthly totals,
							and to the variable <b>RAIN</b> at Rothamsted (ie <b>ROTHMET</b>
							only). It is not applicable to <b>RAINL</b> or <b>RAIN5</b>. To
							convert 5 inch data to ARG100 data, multiply by 1.1. To convert
							ARG100 data to 5 inch, divide by 1.1. We recommend that when you
							download data that spans both gauges, you multiply the 5 inch
							data by 1.1. Please contact the e-RA curators (add link) for more
