<b>Soil texture class: </b> Flinty silty clay loam (U.S. silt loam) over clay-with flints. Moderately well drained, the clay-with-flints subsoil is slowly permeable and hence periodically saturated with water in most years (Avery & Catt, 1995). The soils contain a large number of flints and are slightly calcareous. Below about 2m depth the soil becomes chalk. </p>
