<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
	<b>Rothamsted</b> has one of the longest continuous sets of
	meteorological recordings in the world. Total rainfall and wind
	direction have been measured since 1853, temperature since 1878,
	sunshine from 1890, wind force from 1917, radiation from 1931, wind run
	since 1946 and wind speed since 1960. Annual rainfall averages 704mm
	(1971-2000), but ranges widely from 380mm in 1921 to 973mm in 2000.
	Mean annual temperature 1878-1990 at Rothamsted was 9ºC; average annual
	temperature is now more than 1ºC higher than the 1878-1990 average (for
	more details refer to Guide to Classical Experiments 2006, p 44-45).
	Since January 1st 2004, meteorological records have been measured by a
	range of sensors attached to an automatic data logger; some manual
	observations continued to be made until May 2007.

<p>
	Rothamsted took over the management of the farm at <b>Woburn</b> in the
	1920's and the first meteorological records date back to 1928. Annual
	rainfall averages 649mm (1971-2000). Temperature, rainfall, sunshine,
	wind force and wind direction have been measured since 1928. Wind speed
	and wind run have been measured since 1968 and radiation measurements
	started in 1981. Manual observations ceased on 1st July 1999, and
	meteorological records are now measured by a range of sensors attached
	to an automatic data logger. The mean annual temperature (1971-2000)
	was 9.6 ºC.
</p>

<p>
	Meteorological data was first collected in <b>Brooms Barn</b> in 1963.
	Fewer variables are measured than at Rothamsted and Woburn. Rainfall
	averages 612mm (1963-2008). Mean annual temperature 1964-2008 was
	9.9°C. Dew point, wind run, sunshine hours, vapour pressure and
	relative humidity have also been measured and/or calculated. Data from
	1982 is available in e-RA.
</p>
<p>The Brooms Barn meteorological station is approx. 30m from the
	main buildings, which are approx. 10m high. This may cause some
	interference with the measurement of wind speed and wind direction, as
	ideally a mast with wind sensors should be a minimum of 10 times the
	height of the nearest building away from the nearest building (ie at
	least 100m apart). This gives enough fetch for the wind to settle down.
	The met station and main building have always been in these positions.
