            "description": "Rothamsted has one of the longest running continuous sets of daily meteorological recordings in the world. Temperature has been measured since 1878. The figure above shows the temperature anomaly in annual mean air temperature (black circles), for years 1878 to 2019, relative to the 1878 to 1920 long-term average, which represents the pre-industrial era. Variation in annual temperature is smoothed using an 11-year (132 month) moving average (red line, which removes solar variability and shorter-term variability such as the Southern Oscillation (Hansen et. al., 2010)). The figure shows that air temperatures have risen sharply since 1987 (Scott, 2015) with annual temperatures, over the last decade, estimated to be between 1.3\u00b0C and 1.6\u00b0C higher than the pre-industrial period (Hansen. et. al., 2016). Much of the rise is due to increases in temperature during the autumn and winter months, and at night-time."

For each month the mean air temperature is determined from daily data, also the annual mean air temperature for each year (1878 to 2019). The long-term monthly average and annual average for 1878 to 1920 is also determined. The annual mean temperature anomaly and 132 month (11 year) moving average is determined from these annual and monthly air temperature data using Excel functions."
