		Rothamsted Research at Harpenden has the longest run of
		freely-available daily weather data in England and has been sending
		returns to the UK Meteorological Office since at least 1878. In 2017,
		Rothamsted was recognised by the World Meteorological Organization
		(WMO) as a <a
			href="https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/what-we-do/observations/centennial-observing-stations"
			target="_blank">Centennial Observation Station</a> being one of the
		relatively small number of sites in the UK that has been recording
		reliable observations continuously for more than 100 years. Rainfall
		has been measured daily for more than 160 years, since 1853, using a
		5-inch gauge and a much larger, and unusual, 1,000th of an acre gauge.
		Subsequently, other weather variables were added to the list including
		temperature from about 1878, sunshine hours from 1890, and wind
		force/speed from 1915. Weather variables were recorded manually until
		the end of 2003; an automatic data logger was installed to record the
		data electronically from 1st January 2004*.
	</p>
	<p>The Rothamsted weather records reflect many of the memorable
		national weather events such as the heatwaves of 1976 and 2018, the
		severe winters of 1947 and 1963, the heavy rainfall of December 2015,
		and the drought of 1921. The highs and lows include:

		<strong>Note:</strong> Even earlier records, in the form of a weather
		diary (as opposed to actual measurements), were made by Sir John
		Wittewronge, an ancestor of Sir John Lawes who also lived at
		Rothamsted Manor. These weather records provide a fascinating insight
		into weather conditions over five years at the end of the 17th Century
		(1684-1689) and give an indication of the weather experienced in
		Hertfordshire at a time when the Little Ice Age was affecting Europe (<a

			of Sir John Wittewronge of Rothamsted 1684-1689&quot;. Edited by
			Margaret Harcourt Williams and John Stevenson and published in 1999
			by Hertfordshire Record Society Publications</a>).
	<p>*Some variables such as snow and cloud cover continued to be
		measured manually until May 2007. These trained observers who kept
		records before automation included Chris Hall, Arthur Day, John Croft,
		Dave Yeoman, Bob Norrish, Gavin Harrison, Helen Stevenson, Paul
		Hargreaves, Tim Hall, Edwin Grey and the first recorder, Thomas
		Wilson. The current weather recorder is Tony Scott.
