	<h2>Extreme weather at Rothamsted</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Last updated 20th July 2022. </b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Rothamsted Research at Harpenden has the longest run of
		freely-available daily weather data in England and has been sending
		returns to the UK Meteorological Office since at least 1878. In 2017,
		Rothamsted was recognised by the World Meteorological Organization
		(WMO) as a <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/what-we-do/observations/centennial-observing-stations"
			target="_blank">Centennial Observation Station</a> being one of the
		relatively small number of sites in the UK that has been recording
		reliable observations continuously for more than 100 years. Rainfall
		has been measured daily for more than 160 years, since 1853, using a
		5-inch gauge and a much larger, and unusual, 1,000th of an acre gauge.
		Subsequently, other weather variables were added to the list including
		temperature from about 1878, sunshine hours from 1890, and wind
		force/speed from 1915. Weather variables were recorded manually until
		the end of 2003; an automatic data logger was installed to record the
		data electronically from 1st January 2004*.
	</p>
	<p>The Rothamsted weather records reflect many of the memorable
		national weather events such as the heatwaves of 1976, 2018 and 2022, the
		severe winters of 1947 and 1963, the heavy rainfall of December 2015,
		and the drought of 1921. The highs and lows include:</p>

	<h4>Hottest day</h4>
	<p>
		The highest temperature at Rothamsted (Harpenden), since records began
		in January 1878, recently became <strong>38.4 C on Tuesday 19th July 2022</strong> (this beats the previous record at Harpenden of 36.7 &deg;C on July 25th
			2019). July 19th 2022 was also the record hottest day at the Rothamsted weather stations at Woburn in
		Bedfordshire, with <b>39.5 </b>&deg;C, and at Brooms Barn in Suffolk,
		with <b>38.8</b> &deg;C.

		Seven of these are in 2022 so far; the highest number for one year was 15 record days in 2015; in 1957 there were 12 hottest days; in 1893 and 1906 there were 9 hottest days.

							<strong>Note:</strong> Even earlier records, in the form of a
							weather diary (as opposed to actual measurements), were made by Sir
							John Wittewronge, an ancestor of Sir John Lawes who also lived at
							Rothamsted Manor. These weather records provide a fascinating
							insight into weather conditions over five years at the end of the
							17th Century (1684-1689) and give an indication of the weather
							experienced in Hertfordshire at a time when the Little Ice Age was
							affecting Europe (<a

								Diary of Sir John Wittewronge of Rothamsted 1684-1689&quot;. Edited
								by Margaret Harcourt Williams and John Stevenson and published in
								1999 by Hertfordshire Record Society Publications</a>).
							<p>*Some variables such as snow and cloud cover continued to be
								measured manually until May 2007. These trained observers who kept
								records before automation included Chris Hall, Arthur Day, John
								Croft, Dave Yeoman, Bob Norrish, Gavin Harrison, Helen Stevenson,
								Paul Hargreaves, Tim Hall, Edwin Grey and the first recorder, Thomas
								Wilson. The current weather recorder is Tony Scott.
