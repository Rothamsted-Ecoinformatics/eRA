Since 1965 most of the plots have been divided into four subplots,
one of which remains unlimed and the other three of which receive
varying quantities of lime every four years.
</p>
<P>
The plots are cut in June or July and made into hay. In the early years
the aftermath was grazed by sheep but since 1875 a second cut has
usually been made in the autumn or winter. Before 1960 yields of hay
were recorded and dry matter yields estimated by determining the
percentage dry matter content of samples of hay. The second crop was
usually weighed green although it was sometimes made into hay. Since
1960 yields have been calculated from the weights of produce from sample
strips immediately after cutting by a forage harvester.  Consequently
recorded yields of dry matter are now larger than previously as fewer
losses occur. At the same time, the area harvested to determine yield is
much smaller than it was before 1960 when the entire produce of each
plot was weighed.

The first liming of some subplots took
place in 1881, 1883 and 1887. Regular liming of half of some of the
plots every four years began in 1903 and the scheme was extended in
1920.
</p>
<P>Studies have also been made of the botanical composition of the plots
both through visual surveys and by looking at the percentage
contribution to the hay made by the various species. Often just a
partial separation into grasses, legumes and other species was made. A
recent research project in collaboration with the Open University and
Imperial College has been looking at changes in the botanical
composition of the Park Grass plots.

Chemical analyses of the crops and soil have also been carried out and
physical samples of crops and soils have been preserved.
