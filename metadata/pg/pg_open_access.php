<H1>Park Grass Open Access Data</H1>
<p>Selected data from our long term experiments is being made freely available to the scientific community, as prepared summaries of commonly requested data. This recognises the national and international importance of the data. The aim is that greater use of the data will lead to further understanding and wider benefits. Rothamsted  relies on the integrity of the user to ensure that Rothamsted Research receives suitable academic acknowledgment as being the originators of these data, and offer assistance to users to help ensure that where these data are being applied they are represented and interpreted in a rigorous way. Please contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk">e-RA curators</a> for help with questions about the data or its interpretation.</p>

<h2>Park Grass Species</h2>
<p>The Figure shows the impact of selected treatments on the  number of species comprising 1% or more of the biomass. Applying N as sodium  nitrate (orange line N*) or ammonium sulphate (blue line N) quickly decreased  species numbers relative to the unfertilised control.&nbsp; The continued  application of ammonium decreases species numbers further because of its  acidifying effect on the soil (pH 3.6 in 2011, solid blue line), reducing the number  of species to one or two, <em>Holcus lanatus</em> (Yorkshire Fog) and <em>Anthoxanthum  odoratum</em> (Sweet Vernal Grass). However, even on the nil plot (solid green  line) the number of species has decreased. This may be due to changes in  atmospheric inputs and/or changes in sward management.</p>
<p>Applying chalk (dotted lines) increased soil pH (pH 6.2 in  2011, dotted blue line) and helped some of the species return  to the  original numbers. 
Recent work (Storkey et al 2015) showed that on some plots  withholding N helped increase species diversity as did decreased atmospheric N  deposition, as evident in the species numbers of the nil plot (solid green  line). </p>

<h2>Park Grass pH</h2>
<p>The pH of the soil (at depth 0-23cm) on Park Grass was  approximately 5.5 (in water) when the experiment began. The effects of small  amounts of liming with chalk were tested in the 1880s. A regular test of liming  began in 1903 with chalk applied every 4 years to the southern half of most  plots. From 1965, the plots were further divided: two quarters of the  previously limed half receive amounts of chalk calculated to maintain at pH 7  (sub plot a) and 6 (sub plot b); one part of the formerly un-limed half  receives chalk, where necessary, to maintain pH 5 (sub plot c), and the other  quarter (sub plot d) remains un-limed.</p>
<p>Except where sodium nitrate (orange line N*) has been applied or where liming  with chalk has maintained the pH (dashed  lines), soil has acidified slowly through the impact  of acid deposition from the atmosphere and rapidly where ammonium fertiliser (blue line N) has been applied. Soil pH (0-23cm) is c 3.5 on the plots given most ammonium  sulphate and 5.0-5.3 on the un-limed, unfertilized plots. Sub plot c of most  plots is nearest to the original soil pH. Soil pH has slowly recovered by about  0.5 pH units on plot 9/1d (data not shown), more than 25 years after ammonium sulphate was last  applied.</p>
