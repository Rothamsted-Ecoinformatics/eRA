<H2>Broadbalk Yields</H2>
<P>

The figure shows the mean long-term winter wheat yields from selected treatments on Broadbalk 1852-2016, excluding spring wheat in 2015. The changes reflect the improved cultivars and better
control of pests, diseases and weeds that have been introduced on Broadbalk, especially since the 1960s.  To control weeds, the  experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and one section bare  fallowed each year. The introduction
of herbicides removed the need for  fallowing. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure have remained  at around 1 t ha<sup>-1</sup>.
In 1968 a rotation was  introduced on part of the experiment, so that it is now possible to compare the  yields of wheat grown continuously and as the first wheat after a two year  break. 
Since 1979 summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit the greater grain  yield potential of modern cultivars. From 1985, two higher N rates have been tested, 240 and 288 kg N ha <sup>-1</sup>. 
The highest yields are now from the first wheat crop in
rotation, with the  greatest yields from fertilizer alone exceeding those from FYM alone, and the  combination of FYM + 96 kgN ha<sup>-1</sup> (144 kgN ha<sup>-1</sup> since 2005) often exceeding 
both. The largest annual wheat yields on Broadbalk (>13 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) were recorded in 2014, following the change in variety from Hereward to Crusoe. </p>
<p>The greatest yields were not always achieved with the highest N rate. The figure shows the mean greatest first wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (a maximum of 192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> from 1968-1984). </p>

<H2>Broadbalk Soil Organic Carbon </H2>
<P>

The figure shows the long-term changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) (t ha<sup>-1</sup>) content in the topsoil (0-23 cm) in selected treatments of
the Broadbalk experiment, where winter wheat has been grown each year since 1843 (&quot;continuous wheat&quot;). Data has been calculated from measured % SOC (0-23 cm) and standard
soil weights, adjusted for observed decreases in topsoil bulk density of plots given FYM, by including the appropriate amount of subsoil to ensure 
soil weights were comparable over time. SOC has remained almost constant in the unfertilized plot, at the equilibrium level for this farming system 
on this soil type. Inorganic fertilizer (N3PK) has enhanced SOC a little, probably due to increased returns of organic matter in crop roots and above-ground crop residues. 
The treatment given FYM (35 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) since 1843 now contains almost three times as much SOC as the unfertilized plot. Increases due to FYM were greatest 
in the initial years of the experiment. The same trends can be seen in the FYM treatments that started in 1885 and 1968.

<H2>Broadbalk soil: Concentration of Olsen P (plant-available P) </H2>
<P>
The figure shows changes in plant-available phosphorus (Olsen P) in the topsoil (0-23cm) of selected plots of the Broadbalk Wheat experiment.
Olsen P, which is commonly used to assess plant-available P, is measured by extracting soil with a solution of 0.5M NaHCO3, buffered at pH 8.5. Until 2000, most of the Broadbalk plots had received superphosphate P (35 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>) each year since 1844. Since 2001, applications of P have been withheld on some plots. </p> 
<p>The accumulation of available P was greatest on the FYM plot, reflecting the larger total P inputs in FYM (approx 45 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>) compared to that applied as inorganic fertilizer or where no P was applied. The greater Olsen P concentrations on plot 5 (PKMg) compared to plot 8 (N3PKMg), despite their similar P inputs, were a result of the higher yields and greater P offtakes in the crop on plot 8, due to the applied N. Plot 18 (N4 1/2PKMg) received P at half the standard rate between 1844 and 2001, resulting in relatively low Olsen P concentrations. Since 2001 fertilizer P has been applied at the full rate on this plot, and there has been a corresponding increase in Olsen P. Olsen P concentrations were least on plots receiving no (or very little) P inputs in fertilizer (plot 3, given no fertilizer or manure). Since 2001, fertilizer P has not been applied to plots 5 and 8 (and others not shown), due to the high reserves of plant-available P in the soil. This is reviewed each year. </p>
