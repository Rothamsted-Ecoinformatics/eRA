<h1>Broadbalk Winter wheat experiment </h1>
<P>
The <B>Broadbalk experiment</B> is one of the oldest continuous agronomic experiments in the world.
Started by Lawes and Gilbert in the autumn of 1843, winter wheat has been sown and harvested
on all or part of the field every year since then. The original aim of the experiment was to test the
 effects of various combinations of inorganic fertilizers (supplying the elements N, P, K, Na
 and Mg) and different organic manures on the yield of winter wheat; a control strip has
 received no fertilizer or organic manures since 1843. For the first few years these treatments
 varied a little, but in 1852 a scheme was established that has continued, with some modifications,
 until today.

<H2>Background</H2>

<p>The first experimental crop of wheat was sown on Broadbalk in 1843 and
harvested in 1844. The aim of the experiment was to test the effect of
different organic manures and inorganic fertilizers on the yield of
winter wheat. For the first few years the treatments varied somewhat
but in 1852 a permanent scheme was established which has continued,
with minor modifications, to today. </p>
<P>
The experiment has had three main phases:
 </p>
<p>
<B>1. 1843-1925.</b> The first experimental crop of wheat was harvested in 1844 after a rotation of turnips (with FYM, 1839),
barley (1840), peas (1841), wheat (1842) and oats (1843). The last four crops did not receive any fertilizer or manure.
Winter wheat was grown continuously, apart from occasional fallowing to control weeds.
The experiment was divided into different Strips or 'Plots' (0 - 20) receiving the different fertilizer and manure treatments
each year. Most treatment strips were established by 1852, except for strip 2A, which began in 1885, and strip 20, which began in 1906.
Between 1894 and 1925 many plots were harvested in two halves, Top (T) and Bottom (B), equivalent to the Western and
Eastern parts of the experiment. See  <a href="<?=$metadata?>Broadbalkplan1852-1925.pdf">Broadbalk plan 1852-1925 (pdf); </A>
<a href="<?=$metadata?>Broadbalkcropping1844-1925.pdf">Broadbalk cropping 1844-1925 (pdf)</A>

</p> <p>
<b>2. 1926-1967.</b> The experiment was sub-divided into five 'Sections' (I - V) in 1926, crossing the treatment
 strips at right angles. These were bare fallowed sequentially to control weeds. Fallowing was mainly in a
five year rotation of fallow with four successive crops of wheat.  In 1955 Section I was divided into two;
IA received herbicides as required and was no longer fallowed, IB continued in the five year cycle. In 1955 Section V was divided
into two; VB received a single application of lime, VA did not. In 1963 Section VB was no longer fallowed and received herbicides as 
required, while VA continued in the five year fallowing cycle. See
<a href="<?=$metadata?>Broadbalkplan 1926-1967.pdf">Broadbalk plan 1926-1967 (pdf); </A>
<a href="<?=$metadata?>Broadbalkcropping1926-1967.pdf">Broadbalk cropping 1926-1967 (pdf) </A>

</p> <p>
<b>3. 1968 onwards.</b>  Two major modifications were made from 1968. i) The division of Sections I to V
to create 10 new Sections (0 - 9), so the yield of wheat grown continuously could be compared with that
 of wheat grown in rotation after a two-year break. ii) The introduction of modern, short-strawed cultivars,
 which lead to an increase in grain yields and a decrease in straw yields. The old cultivar Squarehead's Master
 was grown on parts of some plots between 1987 and 1990, enabling a comparison to be made with modern cultivars (shown as  
'S' in the Data Extraction Tool, eg plot 9S). After the 1968 changes, Sections 0, 1, 8 and 9 continued to grow winter wheat only, whilst Sections 2, 4, 7 and
Sections 3, 5, 6 went into two different 3-course rotations (see 1968 cropping details link). In 1978, Section 6
reverted to continuous wheat and the other five Sections went into a five year rotation, currently oats, forage
 maize, wheat, wheat, wheat. Pesticides are applied where necessary, except on Section 6, which does not receive
 spring or summer fungicides. Herbicides have been used as required since 1964 on all of the experiment, except for 
Section 8 (old Section VA), which has never received herbicides. On Section 0 the straw on each plot has been chopped 
after harvest and incorporated in the soil since autumn 1986; on all other Sections the straw is baled and removed. See

</p>
<p>

Lawes and Gilbert installed a tile drain at the centre of each treatment strip and used these to collect and
 measure the nutrients in the water that leached through the soil.  After 150 years many of these drains had 
collapsed and in 1993 Section 9 was re-drained so that water leaching through the soil could again be collected
 and analysed. </p>
<p>Lime has been applied as required since the 1950s to maintain soil pH at a level at which crop yield is not limited.</p>
<p>From 2001 P has not been applied to some plots until levels of plant available P decrease to more appropriate agronomic levels.
This is reviewed each year.</P>
