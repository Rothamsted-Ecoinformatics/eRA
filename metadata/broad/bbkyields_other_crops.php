<H1>Broadbalk Yields - Other Crops</H1>
<p><strong>Broadbalk Description  of other crop yield data</strong><br />
  Other arable crops have been included in the rotational  sections of Broadbalk since 1968 (<a href="Cropping on BBK" target="_blank">see Cropping plan for details</a>). Yield  data is available from the following datasets:<br />
  <br />
  <strong>BKBEANS</strong> Spring  bean grain and straw yields 1968 -1978<br />
  <strong>BKPOTATO</strong> Potato  tuber yields 1968 -1996<br />
  <strong>BKOATS</strong> Winter  oat grain and straw yields 1996 - current year<br />
<strong>BKMAIZE</strong> Forage  maize whole crop yields 1997 - 2017</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Spring field beans</strong> (<em>Vicia faba</em>) were grown on the rotational  sections of Broadbalk between 1968 
and 1978, as part of the potato &gt; beans  &gt; wheat rotation on sections 2, 4 and 7. For full details of the cropping  
sequence see <a href="<?php echo $metadata ; ?>Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf" target="_blank">Cropping 
on Broadbalk</a>. The varieties were Maris Bead (1968-74),  Minor (1975) and Minden (1976-78). The beans were sown in March and generally  
harvested in September. The crops received the same inorganic fertilizer (including N) and  FYM applications as the wheat crops. 
Grain and straw yields at 85% DM and  thousand grain weights are available. Sowing and harvest dates are available  from the e-RA 
Curators. </p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Potato</strong> (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em>) was grown on the  rotational sections of Broadbalk between 1968 and 1996, as 
part of the  potato &gt; beans &gt; wheat rotation of Sections 2, 4 and 7 (1968-78) and then as  part of the potato &gt; wheat &gt; 
wheat &gt; wheat &gt; fallow rotation of Sections  2-5 and 7 (1979-96). For full details of the cropping sequence see 
<a href="<?php echo $metadata ; ?>Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf" target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. 
The varieties grown were Majestic (1968-69), King Edward  (1970-75), Pentland Crown (1976-93), Estima (1994-96). The crops received 
the  same inorganic fertilizer and FYM applications as the wheat crops. Chitted  potato seed was generally planted in April and 
harvested in September; please  apply to the e-RA Curators for a full list of dates since 1968. The potatoes were usually harvested
earlier than normal to allow timely drilling of winter wheat, hence the yields are lower than might be expected.<br />
  <br />
Data available includes total tuber yield, tuber DM content  and % ware (tubers that do not pass through a 3.81cm &lsquo;riddle&rsquo; 
or grader).  &lsquo;Ware&rsquo;  potatoes are those grown for human consumption, which need to be a minimum  size, generally over 40mm. 
Potatoes are graded according to size, using a  potato riddler. </p>
<p><br />
<strong>Winter oats</strong> (<em>Avena sativa</em>) has been grown on the  rotational sections 2-5 and 7 since 1996, as part of the  
wheat &gt; wheat &gt; wheat &gt; oats &gt; maize rotation. For full details of the  cropping sequence 
see <a href="<?php echo $metadata ; ?>Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf" target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. 
The varieties grown were  Image (1996-2000), Revisor (2001) and Gerald (2002-onwards). Revisor, a spring  variety, was sown in 2001 
due to poor autumn weather preventing a winter  variety from being sown. Oats are generally sown in October and harvested in  August; 
please apply to the e-RA Curators for a full list of dates since 1996. <strong>No fertilizer N or FYM is applied</strong> to  the oats 
crops, though K and Mg are applied as usual. Thus, on plots were P and K is not limiting, any differences in yield between treatments are due to 
residues of inorganic N from previous applications or from differing amounts of N being mineralised from the soil organic matter. </p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Forage maize</strong> (<em>Zea mays</em>) is grown as a whole crop, for  silage. It has been grown in the rotational 
sections 2-5 and 7 since 1997, as  part of the wheat &gt; wheat &gt; wheat &gt; oats &gt; maize rotation. Maize is a C4 plant. 
As such, the carbon it contains has a different <sup>13</sup>C "signature" than that in the C3 plants that have been grown previously on Broadbalk. Thus, we can distinguish maize-derived organic matter from that of organic matter already in the soil. For full details  of the 
cropping sequence see <a href="<?php echo $metadata ; ?>Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf" target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. 
The variety Hudson has been grown since 1997. Forage maize is generally sown in May and harvested  in September; please apply to the e-RA Curators for a full list of dates 
since  1997. Maize receives the usual inorganic fertilizer and FYM applications, the  same as wheat. <b>In 2013, forage maize yields may have been reduced, due to the accidental 
application of herbicide to the crop in June/July 2013.</b> The last crop of forage maize was grown in 2017. A new rotation including winter beans instead of maize was started in 2018.  </p>
