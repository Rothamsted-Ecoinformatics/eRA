<h2>Broadbalk Earthworm measurements</h2>
<p>Earthworm populations were assessed on Broadbalk in 1920-21,
	1979, 2014 and 2015. Details are given below. The results are not
	directly comparable, as different methods were used for each
	assessment.</p>
<h3>Feb 1920-Jan 1921 (Morris, 1922)</h3>
<p>Morris recorded insect and other invertebrate fauna, including
	earthworms, on Broadbalk between February 1920 and January 1921.
	Samples were taken from two plots: FYM (Plot 2), receiving 35t/ha FYM
	annually since 1843 and the unfertilized plot (Plot 3) - no fertiliser
	or manure since 1843.</p>
<p>Samples were taken from the Western end of the plots, using a
	metal box 23x23cm with a total of five depths: 0-2.5cm, 2.5-7.6cm,
	7.6-12.7cm, 12.7-17.8cm and 17.8-23cm. 23 samples were taken from each
	plot, approximately every 12 days, between Februrary 1920 and January
	1921. Soil was not sampled on rainy days, due to the difficulty of
	examining wet soil. FYM was applied to Plot 2 and the Plots were
	ploughed on October 13th 1920. The plough depth was around 14-16cm,
	i.e. the fourth layer measured.</p>
<p>
	Earthworms were defined as belonging to the sub-order <i>Terricolae</i>
	in the order <i>Oligochaeta</i>, including <i>Lumbricus sp</i>.
</P>
<p>
	<b>Results</b>:
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong> Earthworms were recorded in all 12 months, and in all
	five depths (0-23cm)<br /> <strong></strong> Earthworms were most
	common in the second soil layer sampled (2.5-7.6cm deep)<br /> <strong></strong>
	Over twice as many earthworms were present in the plot given FYM since
	1843 as in the plot never given fertiliser or manure<br /> <strong></strong>
	A total of 2.50 million earthworms/hectare (250/m2) were recorded in
	the FYM plot from 23 samples<br /> <strong></strong> A total of 1.13
	million earthworms/hectare (113/m2) were recorded in the unfertilized
	plot from 23 samples<br /> <strong></strong> Earthworms were thought
	to occur at deeper depths than 23cm in both plots <br />


</p>
<h3>September 1979 (Edwards &amp; Lofty, 1982)</h3>
<p>
	Edwards &amp; Lofty measured earthworm numbers and total biomass in various
	Broadbalk plots growing continuous winter wheat, to investigate the
	effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. Earthworm populations were sampled
	in September 1979 by pouring dilute formalin on to 16 0.25 m
	<sup>2</sup> quadrats and
	collecting the worms that were brought to the surface. </sup>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Results</b>:
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong> All species of earthworm were more numerous in plots
	treated with organic fertilizers<br /> <strong></strong> There was a
	strong positive correlation between the amounts of inorganic N
	fertilizer applied and populations of earthworms <br /> <strong></strong>
	Plots receiving both inorganic and organic N had the largest
	populations of earthworms<br />

<h3>
	Spring 2014 (Sizmur <i>et al</i>, 2017)
</h3>
<p>Earthworm surveys were carried out on four parts of Broadbalk in
	spring 2014, receiving the following treatments each year:</p>
<li><b>NPK</b>: 144kgN/ha plus PK since 1852. Straw removed (Plot
	8, Section 1)</li>
<li><b>NPK+straw</b>: 144kgN/ha plus PK since 1852. Since 1986
	straw incorporated each year (Plot 8, Section 0)</li>
<li><b>FYM</b>: 35t/ha FYM since 1885, plus fertilizer N since 1968
	(96 kgN/ha 1968-2004, 144 kgN/ha since 2005). Straw removed (Plot 2.1,
	Section 1)</li>
<li><b>FYM+straw</b>: 35t/ha FYM since 1885, plus fertilizer N
	since 1968 (96 kgN/ha 1968-2004, 144 kgN/ha since 2005). Since 1986
	straw incorporated each year (Plot 2.1, Section 0)</li>
<p></p>

<p>A 1m x 14m area on the northern edge of each plot was used,
	divided into four equal sub-plots. Two earthworm surveys were carried
	out in each sub-plot, a total of 8 surveys per treatment.</p>
<p>
	Earthworm surveys were conducted by excavating a 20 x 20 x 20cm cube of
	soil, which was brought back to the laboratory and sorted to find and
	identify all the earthworms. Deep burrowing (anecic) earthworms were
	extracted by pouring a 5 L aqueous solution containing 6g/l of mustard
	flour (see Sizmur <i>et al</i> 2017 for full details).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Results</b>:
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong> Plots given FYM contained a significantly greater
	biomass and number of earthworms than the plots never given FYM <br />
	<strong></strong> Total earthworm biomass was 109 g/m2 in plots given
	FYM, compared to 6 g/m2 in plots never given FYM <br /> <strong></strong>
	Total earthworm numbers were 400/m2 in plots given FYM, compared to
	70/m2 in plots never given FYM <br /> <strong></strong> 28 years of
	straw incorporation had no significant effect on the earthworm
	populations <br /> <strong></strong> There was no significant
	interaction between straw and FYM on earthworm abundance or biomass <br />

</p>
<p>
	Earthworm biomass and abundance were also measured in spring 2014 on
	the <a href="experiment/rcs326">long-term straw incorporation experiment</a> at Rothamsted, which had four rates of cereal
	straw incorporated annually for 28 years. The highest rate of straw
	(20t/ha) resulted in significantly greater earthworm abundance and
	biomass. See Sizmur <i>et al</i> (2017) for more details.

<h3>
	Autumn 2015 (Stroud <i>et al</i>, 2016)
</h3>
<p>
	Stroud <i>et al </i> carried out midden counts on two Broadbalk plots
	in September 2015, to assess populations of anecic, deep burrowing <i>Lumbricus
		terrestris</i> earthworms. The plots received the following treatments
	each year:
</p>
<li><b>NPK</b>: 144kgN/ha plus PK since 1852. Straw removed (Plot
	8, Section 1)</li>
<li><b>FYM+N</b>: 35t/ha FYM since 1885, plus fertilizer N since
	1968 (96 kgN/ha 1968-2004, 144 kgN/ha since 2005). Straw removed (Plot
	2.1, Section 1)</li>
<p></p>
<p>
	Midden assays (5 m2 per plot) were carried out with 1 m2 mustard
	validation assays. 1.5l of mustard solution containing 20g mustard
	powder in water were poured within a 0.25 m2 square quadrat in a random
	location within the plot. Earthworms (<i>L. terrestris</i>) were
	collected for species analysis and then released. The results are not
	directly comparable with earlier assessments, as different methods were
	used.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Results</b>:
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong> The plot ammended with FYM + N contained 0.3 middens
	per m2 <br /> <strong></strong> The plot ammended with NPK contained
	0.13 middens per m2 <br />
</p>
<p>
	Middens counts were also carried out on three other arable sites at
	Rothamsted and Woburn, with and without organic ammendments (straw,
	biosolids, and organic wastes). Organic matter applications enhanced <i>L.
		terrestris</i> populations, however these populations were very low, never
	exceeding 4.6 per m2. See Stroud <i>et al</i> (2016) for more details.
