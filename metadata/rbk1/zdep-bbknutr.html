
	<h2>Broadbalk Crop Nutrient Content</h2>
	<p>The Broadbalk experiment was started in 1843 to investigate the
		relative importance of the plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus,
		potassium, magnesium and sodium (N, P, K, Mg and Na) on grain yield of
		winter wheat. From the very start of the experiment, samples of wheat
		grain and straw were kept from each plot, for chemical analysis,
		though some early samples were lost because the containers were
		damaged.</p>

	<h3>
		Early analysis
	</h3>
	<p>Lawes and Gilbert carried out analyses of wheat grain and straw
		for N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na content on proportionally bulked samples
		from 10 plots, representing four ten-year periods (1852-1861,
		1862-1871, 1872-1881 and 1882-1891). The results for crops grown in
		1852-1871 were published in detail (Lawes &amp; Gilbert, 1884).
		However, only the results for P, K, and Na content for four of the 10
		plots for the second period (1872-1891) were published (Gilbert,
		1895). Johnston (1969) summarises these early analyses.</p>

	<p>Johnston (1969) also measured N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na in grain
		and straw of the last two crops of Squarehead�s Master grown in 1966
		and 1967, on samples taken from all plots in the continuous wheat
		section, last fallowed in 1951, and from all sections carrying the
		first wheat after fallow. These were compared with samples from
		1852-91 (mean of 1966-67 only, not individual values).</p>


	<a id="SEC2"></a>
	<h3>
		1968 to present
	</h3>
	<p>In 1968 Broadbalk was divided into 10 sections. It was decided
		that it was no longer practical to keep samples for chemical analysis
		from all plots (10 sections x 19 plots). Each year only wheat grain
		and straw were kept from each continuous wheat plot on Section 1 (19
		plots) and from plots where wheat followed potatoes and beans
		(Sections 2, 4 and 7, 1968-1978). Potato tubers and bean grain and
		straw samples were also kept. Dyke et al (1983) summarises plant
		nutrients in crops grown between 1968-1978. All samples from 1970-75
		were analysed for %N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na. Samples from 1976-78 were
		analysed for %N only.</p>
	<p>Thorne et al (1988) measured crop dry matter yield and %N, %P
		and %K from anthesis to maturity, from 1969-1984 on selected plots on
		Broadbalk � plots 07, 08, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21 and 22. Data was from
		first and second wheats in rotation with potatoes and beans. They also
		measured many other plant properties, including LAI, grain dry weight,
		number of ears, number of grains per ear, and total above-ground dry
		weight. Harvest index, date of anthesis and date of senescence were
		calculated.</p>
	<p>From 1979-1985 %N was measured in grain and straw from the
		continuous wheat (Section 1) and the first wheat crop of the rotation,
		and in the potato tubers. From 1986-1995 %P, K, Ca, Mg and Na were
		also measured.</p>
	<p>From 1996 %S was also measured (except in 2002). Nutrients were
		also measured in more continuous wheat sections (Sections 0 and 9
		every year, and Section 8 in some years), and more of the rotational
		wheat sections.</p>

	<h3>
		Methodology
	</h3>





	<h4>
		Nitrogen (N)
	</h4>

	<p>
		<b>1968-1995:</b> nitrogen content was determined by Kjeldahl digest,
		the digest was then analysed colorimetrically using a Technicon
		segmented flow analyser. If nitrate-N was expected to be high in the
		sample, the salicylic acid modification was used (Bremner, 1965).
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>1996 onwards:</b> nitrogen content is determined by combustion
		analyser, based on the Dumas method. Originally a Heraeus Combustion
		analyser, currently a LECO combustion system is used.
	</p>


	<h4>
		Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca),
			Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na) and Sulphur (S)
	</h4>

	<p>
		<b>1968-late 1980s:</b> dry ashing techniques, as described by Piper
		(1942) were used to produce an acid extract. The extracts were
		analysed for P colorimetrically on a Technicon Auto Analyser, or later
		equivalents (Alpkem continuous flow system / Skalar SanPlus segmented
		flow system), using the modified Murphy &amp; Riley (1962) molybdenum
		blue method developed from Fogg &amp; Wilkinson (1958). K, Ca, Mg and
		Na were determined using automated atomic absorption methods. The SP90
		atomic absorption flame photometer was used to analyse Ca, Mg and Na;
		K was analysed by the EEL flame photometer until 1973, K was then
		analysed with Ca, Mg and Na by the SP90. S was not routinely measured
		until 1996.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>1980s onwards:</b> since the late 1980s the open tube
		nitric-perchloric digestion (Zarcinas, et al, 1987) has been used to
		produce an acid extract. P, K, Ca, Mg and Na have been determined by
		ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission Spectrometer)
		since 1982, and S since 1996.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Blank (control) values:</b> Data for sodium is presented after the
		analysis blanks (controls) have been subtracted from the raw data.
		Sodium blank values tend to be relatively large, and can be greater
		than the raw data. If subtracting the blank resulted in a negative
		value, this is shown as zero. Thus the sodium data should be treated
		with some caution. Blank (control) readings for the other nutrients
		are very small, relative to the treatment values, and have not been
		subtracted.
