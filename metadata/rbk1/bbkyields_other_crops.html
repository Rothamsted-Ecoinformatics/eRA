<h1>Broadbalk Yields - Other Crops and Fallow</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Broadbalk Description of other crop yield data</strong><br />
	Other arable crops and fallow have been included in the rotational
	sections of Broadbalk since 1968 (<a href="Cropping on BBK"
		target="_blank">see Cropping plan for details</a>). See below for
	further details of fertilizer applications and other treatments,
	including to the <b>fallow sections </b>. Yield data is available from
	the following datasets:<br /> <br /> <strong>BKBEANS</strong> Spring
	bean grain and straw yields 1968 -1978; Winter bean grain and straw
	yields 2018 -<br /> <strong>BKPOTATO</strong> Potato tuber yields 1968
	-1996<br /> <strong>BKMAIZE</strong> Forage maize whole crop yields
	1997 - 2017<br /> <strong>BKOATS</strong> Winter oat grain and straw
	yields 1996 - current year<br />
</p>
<p>
	<br /> <strong>Spring field beans</strong> (<em>Vicia faba</em>) were
	grown on the rotational sections of Broadbalk between 1968 and 1978, as
	part of the potato &gt; beans &gt; wheat rotation on sections 2, 4 and
	7. For full details of the cropping sequence see <a
		href="&lt;?php echo $metadata ; ?&gt;Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf"
		target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. The varieties were Maris
	Bead (1968-74), Minor (1975) and Minden (1976-78). The beans were sown
	in March and generally harvested in September. The crops received the
	same inorganic fertilizer (including N) and FYM applications as the
	wheat crops. The N is applied in the seedbed. Grain and straw yields at
	85% DM, thousand grain weights, variety, sowing and harvest dates are
	available from dataset BKBEANS.
</p>
<p>
	<br /> <strong>Winter field beans</strong> (<em>Vicia faba</em>)
	replaced forage maize on the rotational sections of Broadbalk from <b>2018</b>
	onwards, and the rotation was changed to wheat/wheat/oats/wheat/beans.
	For full details of the cropping sequence see <a
		href="&lt;?php echo $metadata ; ?&gt;Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf"
		target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. The beans are sown in the
	autumn and harvested in August/September. No fertilizer N or FYM is
	applied; P, K and Mg are as for the wheat crops. Grain and straw yields
	at 85% DM and thousand grain weights are available, along with variety,
	sowing and harvest dates from dataset BKBEANS.
</p>
<p>
	<br /> <strong>Potato</strong> (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em>) was grown
	on the rotational sections of Broadbalk between 1968 and 1996, as part
	of the potato &gt; beans &gt; wheat rotation of Sections 2, 4 and 7
	(1968-78) and then as part of the potato &gt; wheat &gt; wheat &gt;
	wheat &gt; fallow rotation of Sections 2-5 and 7 (1979-96). For full
	details of the cropping sequence see <a
		href="&lt;?php echo $metadata ; ?&gt;Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf"
		target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. The varieties grown were
	Majestic (1968-69), King Edward (1970-75), Pentland Crown (1976-93),
	Estima (1994-96). The crops received the same inorganic fertilizer and
	FYM applications as the wheat crops. Fertilizer N was applied in the
	spring, before rotary cultivation to prepared the seedbed. Chitted
	potato seed was generally planted in April and harvested in September;
	please apply to the e-RA Curators for a full list of dates since 1968.
	The potatoes were usually harvested earlier than normal to allow timely
	drilling of winter wheat, hence the yields are lower than might be
	expected.<br /> <br /> Data available includes total tuber yield,
	tuber DM content and % ware (tubers that do not pass through a 3.81cm
	&lsquo;riddle&rsquo; or grader). &lsquo;Ware&rsquo; potatoes are those
	grown for human consumption, which need to be a minimum size, generally
	over 40mm. Potatoes are graded according to size, using a potato
	riddler.
</p>

<p>
	<br /> <strong>Forage maize</strong> (<em>Zea mays</em>) was grown as
	a whole crop, for silage. It has been grown in the rotational sections
	2-5 and 7, 1997-2017, as part of the wheat &gt; wheat &gt; wheat &gt;
	oats &gt; maize rotation. Maize is a C4 plant. As such, the carbon it
	contains has a different <sup>13</sup>C "signature" than that in the C3
	plants that have been grown previously on Broadbalk. Thus, we can
	distinguish maize-derived organic matter from that of organic matter
	already in the soil. For full details of the cropping sequence see <a
		href="&lt;?php echo $metadata ; ?&gt;Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf"
		target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. The variety Hudson was
	grown 1997-2014, and the variety Severus 2015-2017. Forage maize is
	generally sown in May and harvested in September; please apply to the
	e-RA Curators for a full list of dates since 1997. Maize receives the
	usual inorganic fertilizer and FYM applications, the same as wheat. <b>In
		2013, forage maize yields may have been reduced, due to the accidental
		application of herbicide to the crop in June/July 2013.</b> The last crop
	of forage maize was grown in 2017. A new rotation including winter
	beans instead of maize was started in 2018.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	<br /> <strong>Winter oats</strong> (<em>Avena sativa</em>) has been
	grown on the rotational sections 2-5 and 7 since 1996, as part of the
	wheat/wheat/wheat/oats/maize rotation. For full details of the cropping
	sequence see <a
		href="&lt;?php echo $metadata ; ?&gt;Broadbalkcropping1968onwards.pdf"
		target="_blank">Cropping on Broadbalk</a>. The varieties grown were
	Image (1996-2000), Revisor (2001) and Gerald (2002-onwards). Revisor, a
	spring variety, was sown in 2001 due to poor autumn weather preventing
	a winter variety from being sown. Oats are generally sown in October
	and harvested in August; please apply to the e-RA Curators for a full
	list of dates since 1996. <strong>No fertilizer N or FYM was
		applied</strong> to the oats crops harvested 1996-2017; K and Mg were applied
	as usual. Thus, on plots were P and K is not limiting, any differences
	in yield between treatments were due to residues of inorganic N from
	previous applications or from differing amounts of N being mineralised
	from the soil organic matter.
</p>

<p>
	Since <b>2018</b> the rotation was changed to
	wheat/wheat/oats/wheat/beans, and N is now applied to the oats at 1/2
	the usual rate as a single application in mid-April (i.e. 24, 48, 72,
	96, 120 and 144 kgN/ha). FYM is applied at the usual rate to the
	sections growing oats.
</p>

<p>
	<br /> <strong>Bare fallow, 1968-1995</strong> was included as part of
	the three year rotation (wheat > wheat > fallow) on sections 3, 5 and 6
	from 1968-1979, and as part of the three or five year rotation on
	sections 2-5 and 7 from 1979-1995. The fallow sections received FYM and
	castor meal, and the autumn inorganic fertilizers (P, K, Na and Mg) at
	the same time as the cropped sections (in the autumn, before
	ploughing). However, <strong>no inorganic N was applied to the
		fallow sections</strong>. The fallow sections were cultivated several times, to
	remove weeds, and herbicides were also applied. The continous wheat
	sections (0, 1, 6, 8 and 9) are occasionally bare fallowed to control
	perennial weeds, most commonly Section 8 (which does not receive
	herbicides).
</p>

<p>
	<br /> <strong>Bare fallow, 1926-1967. </strong> Regular bare
	fallowing was introduced in 1926, with cultivations to kill the weeds.
	No FYM, castor bean meal or inorganic fertilizer was applied to the
	fallow sections. This decreased the soil organic matter content,
	especially on the plots usually given FYM. No herbicides were applied
	to the fallow sections.
