            "description": "Until 2000, most of the Broadbalk plots had received superphosphate P (35 kg P ha-1) each year since 1852. Since 2001, applications of P have been withheld on some plots. The accumulation of available P was greatest on the FYM plot, reflecting the larger total P inputs in FYM (approx 45 kg P ha-1) compared to that applied as inorganic fertilizer or where no P was applied. The greater Olsen P concentrations on plot 5 (PKMg) compared to plot 8 (N3PKMg), despite their similar P inputs, were a result of the higher yields and greater P offtakes in the crop on plot 8, due to the applied N. Plot 18 (N4 1/2PKMg) received P at half the standard rate between 1852 and 2000, resulting in relatively low Olsen P concentrations. Since 2001 fertilizer P has been applied at the full rate on this plot, and there has been a corresponding increase in Olsen P. Olsen P concentrations were least on plots receiving no (or very little) P inputs in fertilizer (plot 3, given no fertilizer or manure). Since 2001, fertilizer P has not been applied to plots 5 and 8 (and others not shown), due to the high reserves of plant-available P in the soil. This is reviewed each year."
