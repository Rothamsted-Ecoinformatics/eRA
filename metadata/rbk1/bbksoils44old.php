<H1>1944 Soil Sampling</H1>



<BR>
In 1944 the 0-9 inch (0-23cm) surface soil was sampled with uniform spade slices and the 9-18 inch (23-46cm) subsoil was sampled with a semi-cylindrical auger.  Samples were taken from four holes in each of the five sections on each plot i.e. 2A, 3, 5 to 19, from Section 1 only on plot 20.  The sampling positions in each section were determined by starting with a random choice of either North or South side, between 2 and 14 yards (1.8 and 12.8m) from the end of the plot and then moving about one-quarter of the length of the plot section on the other side and so on.<P>
The air-dired samples were sieved &lt 1/4inch (&lt6mm) and weight of stones recorded.  500g was then sieved &lt2mm. Determination of pH and CaCO<SUB><FONT SIZE = -1>3</FONT></SUB>was carried out on &lt2mm.

The following methods were used for the analysis of the 1944 samples.<BR><P>
