<h2>Broadbalk grain quality data</h2>
<p>The Broadbalk experiment was started in 1843 to investigate the
	relative importance of different fertilizers and manures on the grain
	yield of winter wheat. Since 1974, the wheat grain has been regularly
	analysed for standard grain quality characteristics.</p>

<h2>
	<strong>Methodology and background information</strong>
</h2>
<p>
	<b>TGWs:</b> The thousand grain weight is the weight in grams of 1000
	cereal kernels. It is determined using an automatic grain counter.
	After counting, the grain is dried overnight at 105 degrees C. TWGs are
	useful for determining the evenness of grain size (by comparing several
	TGWs). The TGW is also important when calculating the drilling rate for
	sowing cereals.
</p>

<p>
	<b>HFN:</b> The Hagberg Falling Number is a recognised international
	test used by millers to assess the level of germination/sprouting
	within a batch of wheat intended for bread making. Developed in the
	1950s, the Hagberg apparatus measures the time taken for a plunger to
	fall through a standardised hot slurry of milled wheat flour. As wheat
	begins to germinate it produces the enzyme alpha-amylase, which reduces
	the bread making potential of the wheat, and reduces the HFN. A HFN of
	300 seconds or more is generally accepted as the cut-off point for
	bread making. A low HFN would reduce the value of the crop and could
	mean that the grain could only be sold for animal feed. The process
	includes 60 seconds of mixing, when the plunger is automatically
	rapidly lifted up and down by the mechanism. At 60 seconds, the plunger
	is released at its highest point so it can fall through the mixture.
	Thus the minimum possible reading is 60. THe HFN is determined on fresh
	grain. From 2016 the HFN is measured with a Perten Instruments FN1000,
	and is the mean of two readings.
</p>
<p>HFNs in 2007 and 2010 were very low. This is probably because it
	was very wet around harvest, and the grain had started to sprout before
	it could be harvested.</p>

<p>
	<b>HLWT:</b> The hectolitre weight is the weight in kilograms of 100
	litres of grain. It is calculated from specific weight of grain.
	Specific weight of grain is measured using a chondrometer and is equal
	to the weight in grams of a one litre volume of grain. HLWT is
	calculated from specific weight (grams per litre) as g/l x 0.10033 +
	0.42119 = kg/hl. HLWT is determined using fresh grain, and the sample
	is weighed fresh.
</p>
<p>HLWT is used to quantify the size of grains and the proportion of
	broken or thin, shrivelled grain. Millers use HLW to help determine the
	quality of grain and its potential end use as bread, biscuit or pasta
	flours.</p>

<p>
	<b>Size classes:</b> Size classes of grain are determined using a
	Winnower sieve, using fresh grain. The % of grain between 1-3.5mm is
	recorded. This is divided into the % between 1-2.25mm and the % between
	2.25 and 3.5mm. The proportion of grain between 2.25 and 3.5mm is what
	would normally be used by millers for flour. This is calculated by
	subtracting the proportion of grain between 1-2.25mm from the
	proportion of grain between 1-3.5mm. A weighed sample is passed through
	slotted sieves. The same sample is sieved twice, using different sized
	sieves in turn. Screenings are undersized, broken or shrivelled grain
	between 1 and 2.25mm. Admixture comprises impurities, such as straw,
	chaff, weed seeds and earth, which must be removed before milling
	marketable flour. Screenings and admixture represent a loss to the
	miller, so a maximum of 2% is normally allowed.

	In <b>2014</b>, a few of the plots had a measurable amount of grain
	greater than 3.5mm. If you would like this data, please contact the <a

<h2>Early studies</h2>
<p>
	Hectolitre weights (HLWT), derived from bushel weights, are available
	for all plots and sections on Broadbalk from 1844 - 1955, for dressed
	grain measured at threshing. Bushel weight is the weight of a bushel of
	grain (one bushel = 36.369 litres). Bushel weights (measured in
	lbs/bushel) have been converted to HLWT (kg/hl), (one lb = 0.4536 kg).
	From 1844 to 1901 Broadbalk was harvested by hand, and then by binder
	until 1956. The sheaves were 'stooked' on the plot, then carted to a
	barn and stored until threshing in winter, when bushel weight was
	determined by weighing a bushel measure filled with grain (see Atkinson
	<i>et al</i>, 2008 in Key References below). The measurement of bushel
	weights was discontinued in 1955 (Johnston and Garner, 1969). If you
	would like access to this early data, please contact the <a
		href="register.php"> e-RA Curators</a>.

	<b>Grain protein content</b> is an important property, determining
	suitability for breadmaking. A minimum protein content for breadmaking
	wheat in the UK is typically 13% dry basis. Protein % can be calculated
	as %N x 5.7. See <a

		Crop Nutrient Content</a> for details of Broadbalk grain %N.
