<h2>Broadbalk Diseases</h2>
<p>The following wheat root and stem diseases have been assessed on
	selected plots regularly since the introduction of rotations in 1968:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Take-all</b> <i>Gaeumannomyces graminis</i> (Sacc) Arx &
		Oliver var.<i>tritici</i></li>
	<li><b> Eyespot</b> <i>Oculimacula acuformis</i> and <i>Oculimacula
			yallundae</i></li>
	<li><b>Sharp eyespot </b> <i>Rhizoctonia cerealis </i></li>
	<li><b>Brown foot rot </b> <i> Fusarium spp.</i></li>

</ul>

<p>

	The <b>take-all</b> fungus infects winter wheat roots in the autumn
	causing black necrotic lesions on the roots. Early infections can lead
	to uneven growth in the spring and occasionally plant death. If severe
	infection occurs in June/early July above ground symptons often show as
	patches of premature ripening plants with reduced yields and grain
	quality. Comparisons of yields and of differences in amounts of
	take-all between continuous wheat on Broadbalk and wheat in other
	fields growing shorter sequences of cereals culminated in the
	development of the hypothesis of 'take-all decline'. This phenomenon is
	now widely recognised and has been shown to occur in all the
	susceptible cereals.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Eyespot </b>was first identified in the UK in 1935 on Broadbalk. It
	is common on intensively cultivated cereals in heavy soils and is
	favoured by long wet and cold periods in winter and spring. The fungus
	can survive on infected stubble and in the soil for 2-4 years. Early
	symptoms are difficult to assess and can range from a brown smudge to a
	typical eye shaped lesion. Careful removal of the outer leaf sheath can
	reveal a small black dot, the penetrating stroma. It penetrates the
	leaf sheath eventually infecting the stem. Severe infection softens the
	stem, often showing as white heads and can lead to lodging of the crop
	as it matures.
</p>


<p>
	<b>Sharp eyespot</b> causes numerous stem and stem base lesions. The
	fungus overwinters primarily as mycellium on infected stubble but has a
	large host range which can also act as a source of inoculum. As a
	result, the fungus is not easily controlled by rotation. Early symptoms
	show as well defined lesions on the outer leaf sheaths and frequently
	have interveinal tissue shredding within the lesion. Infection can
	occur at any time during the growing season. Late infections often
	remain on the leaf sheaths but early infections can penetrate the straw
	often causing multiple lesions that can be observed as far up the stem
	as the 4th node. Severe infection can cause white heads and make the
	straw brittle. The disease is favoured by cold and dry conditions and
	is less prevalent in intensively cultivated cereals.

</p>

<p>
	<b>Brown foot rot</b> is caused by <i>Fusarium spp.</i> and is both
	soil and seed-borne. Infection often begins at the base of the leaf
	sheath and spreads up the leaf. The fungus continues to spread
	eventually reaching the nodes and straw causing two distinct symptoms.
	An overall general browning, mainly attributed to <i>Fusarium
		culmorum</i>, and streaky brown lesions caused by <i>Microdochium
		nivale</i>. Severe <i>Fusarium</i> infection can result in whiteheads and
	occasionally lodging of the crop.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Measurements</b>
</p>

<p>Take-all, eyespot, sharp eyespot and brown foot rot have been
	routinely assessed on Broadbalk on Sections 9 and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
	wheats of the rotational sections since 1968. Several plots were
	assessed each year and from 1985 mainly plots 7 (N2PKMg), 10 (N2), 11
	(N2P), 13 (N2PK), 15 (N5PKMg) and 21 (FYMN2). Disease assessments were
	generally carried out in late June/early July, at growth stage 69-77.
	Data in e-RA is currently available from 1968 - 2009.</p>


<p>No disease assessments were done from 1982-1984. This was a
	transition period during which the rotation period changed from 3 to 5
	years.</p>

<p>
	The percentage of plants with slight, moderate and severe <b>take-all</b>
	infection is assessed as follows: 0 = no infection (healthy); 1 = < 25%
	of the root system infected (slight take-all); 2 = 25-75% infected
	(moderate take-all); 3 = > 75% roots infected (severe take-all). A
	take-all rating (TAR) is determined (Gutteridge et al., 2003). It is
	calculated as follows: (1x % plants with slight infection) + (2 x %
	plants with moderate infection) + (3 x % plants with severe infection).
	The TAR is a measure of take-all intensity with a range from 0 (no
	take-all) to 300 (severe infection on all plants).
</p>

<p>
	The severity of infection by <b>eyespot</b> is assessed as described by
	Scott & Hollins (1974). Plants with slight eyespot have small lesions
	occupying less than half of the circumference of the straw. Plants with
	moderate eyespot have lesions occupying more than half of the
	circumference of the straw. In plants with severe eyespot the straw is
	completely girdled by lesions and/or tissue softened.
</p>


<p>
	Symptoms of <b>sharp eyespot</b> are often very superficial and a
	distinction is made only between symptoms that are slight, small
	lesions occupying less than half of the circumference of the straw or
	severe where lesions occupy more than half of the circumference of the
	straw and usually extend over more than one internode (Goulds & Polley,
	1990).
</p>


<p>
	<b>Brown foot rot</b> is classified as slight or severe (Goulds &
	Polley, 1990). Plants with slight brown foot rot have either a general
	light browning occupying most of the circumference of the straw
	(typically caused by <i>Fusarium culmorum</i>) or fewer than 5 dark
	brown-black narrow streaks c.1mm wide (typically caused by <i>F.
		nivale</i>). Severe symptoms are defined as a general dark brown
	discoloration of the straw usually extending over more than one
	internode (<i>F. culmorum</i>) or more than 5 brown-black streaks
	greater than 1mm wide (<i>F. nivale</i>).
