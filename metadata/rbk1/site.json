        "description": "The first experimental crop was harvested in 1844 after a rotation of turnips (dunged) 1839, barley 1840, peas 1841, wheat 1842 and oats 1843. The last four crops being entirely unmanured. The field was therefore considered to be exhausted according to contemporary practice.",
