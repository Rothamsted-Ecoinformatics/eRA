            "description": "Soil organic carbon has been measured at intervals since 1865. Data is mean of sections 1, 6 and 9, continuous winter wheat (except for occasional fallow), from six selected plots (3, 5, 8, 2.1, 2.2 and 1). The starting values in 1843 and the later FYM treatments have been estimated. The sections were regularly fallowed from 1926 to 1967, FYM was not applied in fallow years (shown as dashes in the figure).  Lime (chalk) has been applied since the 1950s to maintain soil pH at a level which does not limit yield. Herbicides were introduced in 1964; previously weeds were controlled by cultivation or fallowing. Modern high-yielding cultivars have been used since 1968. Spring and summer fungicides have been applied as necessary since 1978."

SOC is calculated as Total C minus CaCO3-C. Data in 1865 are derived from the original Soda Lime analyses (for Total N) and C:N ratios for 1893 (for organic C). Data for 1966 are corrected Walkey-Black values for organic C. Data for 1987 are Tinsley for organic C. Data for 1992 onwards are Total C  by combustion (LECO) minus CaCO3-C by manometry."
