In some years, the strips were divided into two or more sub-plots. Annual yield data presented here for each strip is the mean of all sub-plots, except when the fertilizer treatments were different (plots 9a and 9b, 15a and 15b, selected years), or if a sub-plot received a different treatment for one year, when it was excluded from the mean. \r\nMost strips were divided into two parallel sub-plots (a and b) 1852-1983; these halves were combined to make one strip in 1894. Strips 5-8, 15 & 16 were divided into top (T) and bottom (B) sub-plots for most years 1894-1925, T and B receiving the same fertilizer treatments. All other strips (except 20) were divided into T and B sub-plots 1912-1925. In some years the strips were divided into three or four sub-plots, of varying sizes. See 'Broadbalk plan and cropping 1852-1925' for full details. \r\nYield data from 1844-1851 is not included, as the fertilizer treatments were not fully established until 1852."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate. Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets."
