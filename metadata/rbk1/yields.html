<h1>Broadbalk Yields</h1>
<p>
	Wheat grain and straw yields have been recorded every year since the
	experiment began, with the first harvest in 1844 (the crop was sown in
	autumn 1843). Dried grain and straw samples have also been kept for
	chemical analysis since 1844; these are preserved in the Rothamsted
	Sample Archive. <br /> Yield data is held in four datasets, which
	reflect the changes to the experimental layout and harvesting
	techniques:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>BKYIELD</strong> Broadbalk wheat grain and straw yields
	1844-1925<br /> <strong>BKYIELD_F</strong> Broadbalk wheat grain and
	straw yields 1926-1953<br /> <strong>BKYIELD_F85</strong> Broadbalk
	wheat grain and straw yields 1954-1967<br /> <strong>BKYIELD_R85</strong>
	Broadbalk wheat grain and straw yields 1968-<em>current year</em>
</p>
<p>See <A HREF="experiment/rbk1/plans#documents">Plans and treatments</A> for more details of changes to the experimental layout over time. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Harvesting:</strong><br /> From 1844 to 1901 the wheat crop
	was cut by hand by scythes, from 1902 to 1956 a self-binder was used,
	originally horse drawn, and then powered by a tractor. Hand cutting
	with scythes was often necessary if the ground was very wet or the crop
	was badly lodged (flattened). After cutting the crop was bound into
	sheaves which were &lsquo;stooked&rsquo; and left on the plot for about
	two weeks then &lsquo;carted<em>&rsquo;</em> into barns where they were
	threshed over the winter. Cutting and carting may have been spread over
	several days. Thus the earlier datasets BBKYIELD and BBKYIELD_F include
	the dates of both cutting and carting the crop. From 1957 the plots
	have been harvested by a small plot combine harvester; only the central
	strip of each plot is taken for yield and samples. Before 1957 the
	plots were usually cut in early August, since 1957 combining has been
	in August or early September. Sowing and harvest dates are available
	from the <a href="info/register">e-RA Curators</a>.

<p>
	<strong>Yields from Section 8 (no herbicides):</strong><br /> Section
	8 has never received herbicides, and many weed species are present.
	Many weed seeds and other weed debris are included in the 'grain' yield
	at harvest. The 'straw' will also include weed material. The FYM plots
	and plots given the higher N rates generally have more weed
	contamination than the other plots. A sub-sample of grain is cleaned
	(weed seeds and debris removed) after harvest, and an estimate of the
	cleaned grain yield made. Data currently in e-RA is of the uncleaned
	grain. It is not possible to correct the straw yield for weed
	contamination. For further details, and the cleaned grain data, please
	contact the <a href="info/register"> e-RA Curators
	</a>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Units:</strong><br /> Since 1954 dry matter (DM) content of
	the grain and straw has been measured at harvest, and all yields have
	been converted to 85% DM (datasets BKYIELD_F85 and BKYIELD_R85). Before
	1954 DM content was not measured and the yields are expressed at the DM
	content at which they were harvested (around 85% DM).

<p>
	<strong>Corrections:</strong><br /> <b>2013 plot 17 Section 3</b>, no
	straw yield was recorded. An estimated value has been used, based on
	the straw/grain ratio of plot 16, Section 3 (a plot with similar grain
	yield): (5.44/8.01) * 7.95 = 5.39 t/ha.
