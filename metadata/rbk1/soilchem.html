<h2>Broadbalk soil chemical properties background information</h2>
<p>The Broadbalk wheat experiment, established in the autumn of
	1843, has been cultivated since at least 1623, and probably much
	earlier (Avery &amp; Bullock, 1969). Soil chemical properties have been
	measured at regular intervals since 1865.</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil pH:</b> The plough layer (0-23 m) is limed when necessary to
	maintain a minimum soil pH of 7.0 – 7.5. Broadbalk was first limed
	regularly from 1955-1967, with plots given the larger inputs of
	ammonium fertilizers receiving more lime than the controls. Liming
	stopped from 1968-1975, but began again in 1976-1992, with 3 or 4
	sections being limed each year. From 2007 onward selected plots have
	been limed every 5-6 years based on soil pH measurements to maintain
	top-soil pH around 7.0-7.5. Selected plots were limed in autumn 2018.
</p>


<h3>Data available</h3>

<p>
	<b>Soil chemical properties</b> have been measured at regular intervals
	on Broadbalk since 1865, in topsoils (0-23cm) and subsoils. See <a

</ul>


<h3>Soil Sampling</h3>
<p>
	Broadbalk soil has been sampled on many occasions over the years.
	However, because the method of sampling has changed and the experiment
	has been divided, first into two halves, then into five sections and
	finally into 10 sections, it is not always advisable to directly
	compare one sampling with another without careful thought. This <a
		href="metadata/rbk1/Soil-sampling-comparisons-over-time-to-2017.pdf"
		target="_blank"> <b>table</b>
	</A> shows, where possible, how samples taken over time relate to each
	other. Selected plots and depths have been sampled on other occasions;
	most samples still exist in the Sample Archive.
</p>

<p>
	Since 1992 a systemic sampling plan has been adopted. In 1992, 1997,
	2005, 2010 and 2015 all five continuous wheat sections were sampled (0,
	1, 6, 8 and 9). In the intervening years the remaining sections in
	rotation were sampled, one per year, so that all sections were sampled
	every five years. All sections were sampled in 2000 prior to treatment
	changes being introduced. See <a
		href="metadata/rbk1/Soil-sampling-comparisons-over-time-to-2017.pdf"
		target="_blank"> <b>table</b>
	</A> for full details.
</p>

<p>In autumn 2004 it was apparent that parts of the field had been
	ploughed slightly deeper than 23cm as sub-soil clay was visible in
	random patches across the field. Thus in 2005 and 2006 all plots were
	resampled to create a new baseline, if necessary, for soil chemical
	properties. The sections were then sampled systematically from 2008
	onwards.</p>
<p>
	In 2000-2004 archived soil samples from selected plots sampled in 1865,
	1881, 1893, 1914, 1936 and 1944 were re-analysed for soil pH, Olsen-P,
	exchangeable cations, Total %N, %SOC and CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C. Values for
	%N and %SOC from the re-analysis of the 1865 samples were very
	different to the original data and the 1881 and 1893 re-analysed soils,
	so the original data was used.
</p>

<p>Data before 1926 (when the experiment was divided into sections)
	are given for whole plots only, from the re-analysis in 2000/2004. More
	recent data are available for individual plots within each section.</p>

<p>
	<b>1936, 1944 and 1966</b> data is included with later data, although
	the experiment was not divided into 10 sections until 1968.
</p>

<p>
	<b>1936 data: </b>10-20 cores taken with a narrow auger from each of
	the five Old Sections were bulked within each plot. Data for Old
	Section I is used for current sections 0 and 1, Old Section II for
	current sections 2 and 3, etc. (see soil sampling plan for more
	details). All the data is from the re-analysis of old samples in
	2001-2002.
</p>

<p>
	<b>1944 data: </b> four holes were taken from each of the (then) five
	Old Sections; holes 1 & 2 were on current Section 0, holes 3 & 4 on
	current Section 1 etc, so the data can confidently be allocated to the
	modern sections. Data is presented as the mean of the two holes for the
	topsoil. Subsoil data is not available for each modern section, as the
	samples were bulked from four-sub-samples for each of the five old
	sections. Data for Old Section I is used for current sections 0 and 1,
	Old Section II for Sections 2 and 3, etc. (see soil sampling plan for
	more details). The soil was re-analysed in 2003-5 from selected plots
	from all Sections and depths. All data is from the re-analysis except
	%CaCO<sub>3</sub> which was analysed in 1944. Soil pH and Exchangeable
	Na were not measured in the 1944 subsoil samples.
</p>

<p>
	<b>1966 data: </b>Section 0 and 1 use data from Old Sections Ia and Ib
	respectively; Sections 2 and 3 use data from Old Section II; Sections 4
	and 5 use data from Old Section III; Sections 6 & 7 use data from Old
	Section IV; Sections 8 and 9 use data from Old Sections Va and Vb
	respectively. Bulked Va and Vb samples (ie Sections 8 and 9) were used
	to determine %SOC (plots 2.1 and 2.2 only) and for all plots for Olsen
	P, %CaCO3 and Exchangeable K. There was no plot 1 in 1966, this was
	created in 1968. The soil was sampled in September 1966 but no day is
	given. It is shown as 15/09/1966 in the database.
</p>
<p>Data from the samplings in 2001-2004 is not included as this only
	covered sections 2, 4, 5 and 7 and there was a comprehensive sampling
	of all sections in 2000 and then in 2005/6.</p>


<h4>Soil Sampling Methods</h4>
<p>
	Samples between <b>1865 and 1914</b> were taken with an open-ended
	metal box, 9 inches (23cm) deep and usually 6 x 6 inches (15 x 15cm)
	across. There were between three and eight sample positions on each
	plot which were bulked together for each depth on each plot. In <b>1944</b>
	a spade was used to sample the 0-23cm layer, and the subsoil (23-46cm)
	was sampled with a semi-cylindrical auger.
</p>
<p>
	In <b>1936</b> and from <b>1966 onwards</b> samples were taken with a
	semi-cylindrical auger. 10-20 cores were taken from the different soil
	layers for each individual plot within each section and bulked together
	for each plot. Small diameter cores taken by semi-cylindrical augers
	cannot be used to determine soil weights, but provided enough are taken
	the sample better represents the proportions of SOC, N, P, K etc in the
	soil than a few large box samples. See <a
		href="http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/experiment/rbk1/soilphys#documents"
		target="_blank"> <b>soil physical properties</b>
	</A>for details of soil weights.
</p>


<p>Samples were taken in the autumn, after the crop had been
	removed, but before ploughing, except for Section 3, 1996 which was
	sampled in March.</p>

<h3>Analysis methods for soil chemical properties</h3>

<p>
	All soil samples are air-dried and sieved <2mm. Data are given for
	air-dried soil (approximately 98% dry matter). When calculating total
	amounts in the soil (e.g. kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> ) you may wish to
	convert to oven-dry soil (i.e. 100% dry matter). Broadbalk <a
		href="experiment/rbk1/soilphys#documents" target="_blank"> <b>standard
			soil weights</b>
	</A> are given for oven-dry soil.

	</p>

<h4>Total soil % nitrogen (%N)</h4>
<p>
	<b>1865:</b> Original soda lime analysis for total N (Johnston, 1969b,
	table 5.10) multiplied by a factor derived from the comparison of soda
	lime and LECO analysis values for 1881 and 1893 samples. Soda lime
	analysis by the method of Will and Varrentrapp (Watt, 1863). See
	Johnston (1969a, p 50) for more details.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1881-1944:</b> Selected samples re-analysed in 2001-4 by combustion
	analysis, based on the Dumas method, using a LECO combustion system.
	Measured on air-dried, finely ground soil (to pass a 355 micron or 44
	mesh sieve).
</p>
<p>
	<b>1966, 1987-8:</b> Kjeldahl digest method for total N (Bremner,
	1965). The digest was then analysed colorimetrically using a Technicon
	continuous flow analyser. Measured on air-dried soil, finely ground to
	pass a 0.5mm sieve.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1992 onwards:</b> Combustion analysis, based on the Dumas method,
	using a LECO combustion system. Measured on air-dried, finely ground
	soil (to pass a 355 micron or 44 mesh sieve).
</p>


<h4>Soil % organic carbon (%SOC)</h4>
<p>
	<b>1865:</b> Derived from original soda lime analysis for total N and
	C:N ratios for 1893 for organic carbon (Dyer, 1902).
</p>
<p>
	<b>1881-1944:</b> Selected samples re-analysed in 2001-4 by combustion
	analysis, based on the Dumas method, using a LECO combustion system to
	measure total carbon. SOC determined as total C minus CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C,
	measured by a calcimeter (see below). Measured on air-dried, finely
	ground soil (to pass a 355 micron or 44 mesh sieve).
</p>
<p>
	<b>1966:</b> Chromic acid titration method (Walkley and Black, 1934).
	Correction factor of W-B x 1.3 used, which is equivalent to organic C
	by Tinsley or total C by combustion minus CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C. But see
	also Johnston (1969b, p 97). Measured on air-dried soil, ground to pass
	a 0.5mm sieve.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1987-8:</b> Dichromate digestion, modified Tinsley (Kalembasa and
	Jenkinson, 1973) to measure organic C. Measured on air-dried soil,
	finely ground to pass a 0.5mm sieve.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1992 onwards:</b> Combustion analysis, based on the Dumas method,
	using a LECO combustion system to measure total C. Measured on
	air-dried, finely ground soil (to pass a 355 micron or 44 mesh sieve).
	SOC determined by subtraction of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C, measured by a
	calcimeter (see below).
</p>

<h4>
	Inorganic carbon (IC) also known as calcium carbonate-C or CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C
</h4>
<p>Soils sampled in 1865-1936 were re-analysed in 2000-4. Most of
	the 1944 data was from the 1944 analysis, except for a few plots (9, 18
	and 19) that were analysed in 2001. IC was not measured in 1987-88, as
	%SOC was determined directly by Tinsley analysis. In other years IC is
	subtracted from total carbon to give %SOC.</p>
<p>
	All samples up to 2012 were analysed by a calcimeter. CO<sub>2</sub> is
	liberated from CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the soil sample by treating with
	hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a closed system. The amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub>
	is calculated by comparing the pressure produced by the sample against
	the pressure produced by known weights of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, using a
	mercury filled manometer. %CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C or %IC is derived from
	%CaCO<sub>3</sub> by dividing by 8.333. Since 2014 inorganic C has been
	measured by an automated Skalar Primacs inorganic carbon analyser.

<h4>
	</A> Soil pH
</h4>
<p>Soil pH in water, with a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension, mean of two
	readings. Soils from selected treatments sampled in 1865-1944 were
	re-analysed in 2000-4. Measured on air-dried soil, sieved < 2mm.</p>

<h4>
	Olsen-P (plant-available phosphorus; also known as bicarbonate
	soluble-P or NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-soluble P)
</h4>

<p>
	Soils from selected treatments sampled in 1865-1944 were re-analysed in
	2000-4. All samples were analysed by the Olsen method, in which soil is
	extracted with a solution of 0.5<i>M</i> NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, buffered at
	pH 8.5 (Olsen et al, 1954). The extract is then analysed by continuous
	segmented colorimetric flow analysis. Measured on air-dried soil,
	sieved < 2mm.
</p>
<p>See Blake et al (2000, 2003) for a discussion of the P balance on
	Broadbalk and changes in soil P fractions over time (Key References,
	below).</p>

<h4>Exchangeable cations - Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium
	(K) and sodium (Na)</h4>
<p>
	Selected soils sampled in 1865-1944 were re-analysed in 2000-6, and
	those sampled in 1966 were re-analysed in 2019. All soils were
	extracted with 1<i>M</i> ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)
	solution, after the method of Metson (1956). The data is expressed as
	mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in dry matter, with 5mg of soil in 100ml of
	leachate. Since 1983, the extracts have been analysed by ICP-OES
	(Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer). Measured
	on air-dried soil, sieved < 2mm.
</p>
<p>Blank (control) values: Analysis blanks were subtracted from
	exchangeable Na, and other cations if necessary (e.g. K in 1987).</p>

<p>
	Samples taken in <b>1966</b> were re-analysed in 2019. The exchangeable
	K values differ from those published by Johnson (1969b), when a
	slightly different technique was used for measuring exchangeable
	cations, which involved swirling the samples in successive amounts of
	ammonium acetate and decanting off the solution once settled. In 1966
	the extracts were measured with a flame photometer. Bolton (1972)
	reports on exchangeable Ca and Mg in Broadbalk soils from 1856-1966 for
	some sections, from the western (top) end of the field, but the 1966
	data has not been found. It is recommended that the re-analysed data
	from 2019 is used for the 1966 samples.
