<H2>Exhaustion land</H2>
<p>Unlike some of the other Classical experiments, which have been modified without losing the continuity of many of their treatments, the <b>Exhaustion Land</b> 
experiment has had several distinct phases since it started in 1856. From 1856 to 1901, annual dressings of N, P, K or FYM (from 1876 only) were
applied. Wheat was grown initially (1856-1875) then potatoes (1876-1901). There were 10 plots from 1876 to 1901.</p>

<p>From 1902 to 1939 no fertilizers or manures were applied and, with a few exceptions, cereals (usually spring barley) were grown. 
From 1940 to 1985, spring barley was grown and N fertilizer applied to all plots every year, initially at a single rate, but in 1976 the 10 main plots were divided 
to test four rates of N. </p>

<p>In 1986, after a long period when the P residues in particular were being “exhausted”, it was decided to see how quickly this decline in soil fertility could be reversed. 
Annual, cumulative dressings of 0 v 44 v 87 v 131 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, as triple superphosphate, were tested on five of the original plots (each divided into four sub-plots).
Basal N and K were applied such that these nutrients did not limit yield. Responses to fresh P were rapid. Applications of P stopped after seven years. No P was applied between 1993 
and 1999, but since 2000, maintenance dressings, equivalent to offtakes by the crop, have been applied (not to the no-fresh-P sub-plots). Wheat has been grown since 1992. Typically, it showed
the same response to available-P as spring barley i.e. above a critical level, <i>on this soil</i>, of about 12 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> there is no further increase in yield. </p>

<p>On the other half of the experiment, the effects of K residues (in the presence of basal P and N) on yield are investigated. Soils are sampled regularly to follow 
changes in plant-available P and K. </p>

<H2>Garden clover</H2>

<p><b>Garden Clover</b> is the smallest and simplest of the Classical experiments, with (until 1956) only one, unmanured plot measuring 3m by 2.1m. 
The experiment was established in the Manor Garden in 1854 to see whether red clover (<i>Trifolium pratense</i>)could be grown continuously on a rich garden soil.
Yields were very large for the first 10 years averaging about 10 t dry matter ha<sup>-1</sup>, probably because the soil was rich in nutrients and the soil-borne pests and diseases of
clover were absent. Reasonable yields were obtained over the next 30 years but thereafter yields showed a marked decline and there were several complete failures.</p>

<p>Between 1956 and 1972 the plot was sub-divided and a sequence of tests made of K, molybdenum (Mo), formalin, N and Mg, but the the crop was usually severely damaged during the 
winter by clover rot (<i>Sclerotinia trifoliorum</i>) and was resown each spring. Since 1973 basal N, P, K, Mg and chalk have been applied.</p>

<p>Between 1976 and 1978 aldicarb was tested as a control for clover cyst nematode, <i>Heterodera trifolii</i>, which was known to be present, and the cultivar Hungaropoly, 
believed resistant to clover-rot, was compared with the standard susceptible variety S.123. </p>

<p>The plot then grew Hungaropoly only, with basal aldicarb (until 1988), and tested the fungicide benomyl from 1980-90. The cultivar was changed to Merviot in 1996. Between 
1979 and 2006 the experiment has been resown seven times. A mean yield of 13t ha<sup>-1</sup> has been achieved in this period, with up to 20 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in some years.</p>

<p>Other than Park Grass, with its mixed herbage, this is the only Classical experiment where only a non-graminaceous crop has been grown. In terms of microbial diversity,
its soil provides a potentially valuable contrast with those of Broadbalk and Hoosfield. </p>

<H2>Barnfield</H2>

<p><b>Barnfield</b> was the first of the Classical Experiments, with treatments applied in spring 1843 for a crop
of turnips sown in July. The treatments and cropping, although mainly roots, differed  until 1876 when a period of continuous cropping with 
mangolds was started that lasted until 1959 (sugar beet were also grown, on half-plots, from 1946). </p>

<p>Treatments during the first two years were on long narrow plots, as on Broadbalk.
After various modification, the design was settled in 1856 when the strips testing minerals and FYM,
including FYM + PK, were crossed at right angles by series comparing no N fertilizer
with both inorganic and organic forms of N supplying 96 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Before 1968 this
was the only Classical in which N was applied with both FYM and FYM + PK fertilizer.</p>

<p>Because yields of continuous roots were declining, perhaps because of increasing
numbers of cyst nematodes (<i>Heterodera schachtii</i>), the cropping has been
progressively modified since 1959 and has included a range of arable crops, with an
increased range of N dressings, and grass. From 1977 to 1983 the series that had
never received N fertilizer was kept fallow. It was sown to a grass-clover ley in 1984.
The remainder has been in grass since 1975. </p>
<p> No treatments have been applied and no yields taken since 2001, although the site is currently still available. </p>

<H2>Agdell</H2>
<p><b>Agdell</b> was the only Classical Experiment in which crops were originally grown in rotation. From 1848 to 1951, three different manurial combinations (none, PKNaMg and 
NPKNaMg plus rape cake, castor meal) were applied to the root crops of two four-course rotations. The rotations differed only in their third course - roots, barley, fallow or 
legume, wheat. There were only six plots and only one course of the rotation was
present each year. The root crop was turnips or swedes, the legume clover or beans. From 1920, club-root (<i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>) became progressively more damaging to 
the root crop, especially on the NPKNaMg plots as a result of increasing soil acidity. By 1948 the produce was too small to weigh, and the four-course rotation ceased in 1951. 
Soil acidity was corrected and the plots were then used to evaluate the P and K reserves accumulated up to 1951. During this period the original six plots were halved and two 
levels of soil organic matter were established by growing leys on one half. Subsequently, the plots were further sub-divided to build up different amounts of P and K in the soil. 
Crop yields were then related to the reserves of P and K in the soil and the effect of adding fresh P and K. The experiment ended in 1990, only archived crop and soil samples 
are now available.

<H2>Highfield and Fosters Ley-Arable, Rothamsted</H2>

<p>The Rothamsted <b>Highfield and Fosters Ley-Arable experiments </b>started in 1949. Their purpose was to look at the effects of different cropping systems 
on soil organic matter (SOM) and yield. The two sites have the same soil type but the cropping
histories of each are very different. Highfield had been in permanent grass since 1838; on this site some plots stayed in permanent grass, others went into continuous
arable cropping and some alternated between leys and arable. In contrast, Fosters has been in arable cropping for several centuries; on this site some plots 
stayed in continuous
arable, some went into permanent grass and others alternated between leys and arable. Although yields are no longer measured, SOM continues to be monitored. 
Even after more than 60 years, SOM contents on these experiments have still not reached new equilibria. In soils ploughed out of permanent grass,
SOM is still declining whilst it continues to increase in soils under permanent grass.</p>

<H2>Highfield Bare Fallow, Rothamsted</H2>

<p>In 1959 an area of permanent grass (since 1838) adjacent to the Highfield Ley-Arable experiment at Rothamsted was ploughed, and has not grown a crop since. 
This is the <b>Highfield Bare Fallow</b>. It is kept free of weeds by frequent cultivation, but herbicides are used occasionally, so inputs of carbon to the soil are negligible.
  Soil organic matter (SOM) is measured periodically, and this has declined substantially since the area was first ploughed out of grass. </p>

<H2>Woburn Ley-Arable</H2>

<p>The <b>Woburn Ley-arable experiment</b> started in 1938 to compare the effects of rotations with or without grass or grass-clover leys on SOM and the yield of two arable test 
crops. Soils at Woburn that have been in continuous arable cropping since 1876 contain about 0.9
% C, and %C is still declining slowly; soils that have alternated between 3-year leys and 2-years arable since 1938 contain about 1.2 % C. Typically, where no fertilizer N is 
applied, grain yields of the first wheat test crop are greater following grass leys than in the continuous arable sequence because more N is available from the mineralisation of SOM. Following grass-clover leys, yield
is increased further because of the extra N being made available from the breakdown of the leguminous residues. Following the leys, a larger yield is often achieved, with less 
fertilizer N, compared with continuous arable cropping. Soils are sampled regularly to measure changes in SOM. </p>

<H2>Woburn Market Garden experiment</H2>

<p>The <b>Market Garden experiment</b> started in 1942, originally to look at the effects on SOM and crop yield of various organic inputs; namely FYM, compost and sewage sludge. 
The experiment was grass from 1974 to 1982. When concerns were expressed in the late 1970s about the heavy metal content of sewage sludges being applied to agricultural land, the 
experiment was “reactivated” to examine the fate of metals that had been applied in the sewage sludge between 1942 and 1961.
More recently, the experiment has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of hyperaccumulator plants, i.e. plants that can naturally accumulate large amounts of metals from
soils and which, potentially, could be used to “clean up” soils contaminated with heavy metals.</p>

<H2>Woburn Organic Manuring experiment</H2>

<p>In 1964 the <b>Organic Manuring Experiment</b> was started on the sandy loam soil at Woburn to test the effects of different types of organic matter inputs on soil organic 
matter (SOM) and crop yields. Initially six organic treatments (FYM, peat, straw, green manures and two grass leys) were compared with two fertilizer-only treatments. Arable crops
were grown in rotation with an eight-level N test 1973-1980 to assess the effects of the increased levels of SOM achieved by the organic amendments. During this period, no organic
manures were applied. There was another treatment phase from 1981-1986, when further organic manures were applied. Again, SOM increased with the organic treatments and the grass
leys but continued to decline slowly where only fertilizers were applied. This treatment phase was followed by another test phase, 1987-1994, when six rates of N were tested on 
arable crops, and no further organic manures were applied. From 1995-2002 arable test cropping continued but only two rates of N were tested. 
In 2003 another treatment phase started. All plots, except for the permanent grass-clover leys (and beans when grown) were split to test six rates of N on arable crops grown in
rotation. </p>
<p>Soil samples have been taken every few years to measure changes in SOM. </p>

every year, except in 1992 when winter oilseed rape was grown. Yields of grain and straw are taken each year, and soil has been sampled after 7, 11 and 22 years of contrasting straw
treatments. </p>

<H2>Continuous maize experiments</H2>

<p>In 1997 two <b>Continuous Maize</b> experiments were started, one at Rothamsted (Hoosfield) and the other at Woburn (Stackyard), to monitor the fate of organic carbon in the 
soil, following inputs of fresh organic matter. Forage maize and spring barley were grown each year. There were six crop and straw treatments: 1. Continuous maize, stubble
incorporated; 2. Continuous maize, stubble plus 10t maize tops incorporated; 3. Maize after three years of spring barley, straw removed; 4. Spring barley after five years maize,
stubble incorporated; 5. Continuous spring barley, straw removed plus 10 t maize tops incorporated; 6. Continuous spring barley, straw removed. Crop yields were taken each year and 
soils were collected in 1997, 2008 and 2015. Maize and spring barley were chosen as crops with contrasting delta <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in their residues. This can be used to 
follow the fate of the C incorporated in the crop residues. The experiment was discontinued in 2015. </p>
