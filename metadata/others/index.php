</div>
<p>
	<b>Barnfield</b> was the first of the Classical Experiments, with
	treatments applied in spring 1843 for a crop of turnips sown in July.
	The treatments and cropping, although mainly roots, differed until 1876
	when a period of continuous cropping with mangolds was started that
	lasted until 1959 (sugar beet were also grown, on half-plots, from
	1946).
</p>

<p>
	Treatments during the first two years were on long narrow plots, as on
	Broadbalk. After various modification, the design was settled in 1856
	when the strips testing minerals and FYM, including FYM + PK, were
	crossed at right angles by series comparing no N fertilizer with both
	inorganic and organic forms of N supplying 96 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>.
	Before 1968 this was the only Classical in which N was applied with
	both FYM and FYM + PK fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
	Because yields of continuous roots were declining, perhaps because of
	increasing numbers of cyst nematodes (<i>Heterodera schachtii</i>), the
	cropping has been progressively modified since 1959 and has included a
	range of arable crops, with an increased range of N dressings, and
	grass. From 1977 to 1983 the series that had never received N
	fertilizer was kept fallow. It was sown to a grass-clover ley in 1984.
	The remainder has been in grass since 1975.
</p>
<p>No treatments have been applied and no yields taken since 2001,
	although the site is currently still available. Recently soil from the
	site was used in a study investigating the response of wheat roots to
	soil P supply (Yuan et al, 2016).</p>

<p>
	<b>Agdell</b> was the only Classical Experiment in which crops were
	originally grown in rotation. From 1848 to 1951, three different
	manurial combinations (none, PKNaMg and NPKNaMg plus rape cake, castor
	meal) were applied to the root crops of two four-course rotations. The
	rotations differed only in their third course - roots, barley, fallow
	or legume, wheat. There were only six plots and only one course of the
	rotation was present each year. The root crop was turnips or swedes,
	the legume clover or beans. From 1920, club-root (<i>Plasmodiophora
		brassicae</i>) became progressively more damaging to the root crop,
	especially on the NPKNaMg plots as a result of increasing soil acidity.
	By 1948 the produce was too small to weigh, and the four-course
	rotation ceased in 1951. Soil acidity was corrected and the plots were
	then used to evaluate the P and K reserves accumulated up to 1951.
	During this period the original six plots were halved and two levels of
	soil organic matter were established by growing leys on one half.
	Subsequently, the plots were further sub-divided to build up different
	amounts of P and K in the soil. Crop yields were then related to the
	reserves of P and K in the soil and the effect of adding fresh P and K.
	The experiment ended in 1990, only archived crop and soil samples are
	now available.

<p>
	<B>Current design:</b> Four plots (each 1 x 1.4m) growing continuous
	red clover (<i>Trifolium pratense</i>), reseeded every 5-6 years. Lime
	and fertilizers (P, K and Mg) are applied in autumn. Vegetation is
	harvested three times a year.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths:</b> The only remaining Classical experiment devoted
	specifically to the study of a legume, and the oldest experiment of its
	kind in the world. Long-term data on clover yields and many archived
	samples (from about 1862) available. Soil samples, which show a decline
	in total N of >50% since 1857, are also available.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Background:</b> the smallest and simplest of the Classical
	experiments, with (until 1956) only one, unmanured plot measuring 3m by
	2.1m. The experiment was established in the Manor Garden in 1854 to see
	whether red clover could be grown continuously on a rich garden soil.
	Yields were very large for the first 10 years averaging about 10 t dry
	matter ha<sup>-1</sup>, probably because the soil was rich in nutrients
	and the soil-borne pests and diseases of clover were absent. Reasonable
	yields were obtained over the next 30 years but thereafter yields
	showed a marked decline and there were several complete failures.
</p>

<p>
	Between 1956 and 1972 the plot was sub-divided and a sequence of tests
	made of K, molybdenum (Mo), formalin, N and Mg, but the the crop was
	usually severely damaged during the winter by clover rot (<i>Sclerotinia
		trifoliorum</i>) and was resown each spring. Since 1973 basal N, P, K,
	Mg and chalk have been applied.
</p>

<p>
	Between 1976 and 1978 aldicarb was tested as a control for clover cyst
	nematode, <i>Heterodera trifolii</i>, which was known to be present,
	and the cultivar Hungaropoly, believed resistant to clover-rot, was
	compared with the standard susceptible variety S.123.
</p>

<p>
	The plot then grew Hungaropoly only, with basal aldicarb (until 1988),
	and tested the fungicide benomyl from 1980-90. The cultivar was changed
	to Merviot in 1996. Between 1979 and 2006 the experiment has been
	resown seven times. A mean yield of 13t ha<sup>-1</sup> has been
	achieved in this period, with up to 20 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in some years.
	In 2013 the clover variety was changed to Milvus
</p>

<p>Other than Park Grass, with its mixed herbage, this is the only
	Classical experiment where a non-graminaceous crop has been grown
	continuously. In terms of microbial diversity, its soil provides a
	potentially valuable contrast with those of Broadbalk and Hoosfield.</p>

<p>
	Unlike some of the other Classical experiments, which have been
	modified without losing the continuity of many of their treatments, the
	<b>Exhaustion Land</b> experiment has had several distinct phases since
	it started in 1856. From 1856 to 1901, annual dressings of N, P, K or
	FYM (from 1876 only) were applied. Wheat was grown initially
	(1856-1875) then potatoes (1876-1901). There were 10 plots from 1876 to
	1901.
</p>

<p>From 1902 to 1939 no fertilizers or manures were applied and, with a
	few exceptions, cereals (usually spring barley) were grown. From 1940
	to 1985, spring barley was grown and N fertilizer applied to all plots
	every year, initially at a single rate, but in 1976 the 10 main plots
	were divided to test four rates of N.</p>

<p>
	In 1986, after a long period when the P residues in particular were
	being “exhausted”, it was decided to see how quickly this decline in
	soil fertility could be reversed. Annual, cumulative dressings of 0 v
	44 v 87 v 131 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, as triple superphosphate, were
	tested on five of the original plots (each divided into four
	sub-plots). Basal N and K were applied such that these nutrients did
	not limit yield. Responses to fresh P were rapid. Applications of P
	stopped after seven years. No P was applied between 1993 and 1999, but
	since 2000, maintenance dressings, equivalent to offtakes by the crop,
	have been applied (not to the no-fresh-P sub-plots). Wheat has been
	grown since 1992. Typically, it showed the same response to available-P
	as spring barley i.e. above a critical level, <i>on this soil</i>, of
	about 12 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> there is no further increase in yield.
</p>

<p>On the other half of the experiment, the effects of K residues (in
	the presence of basal P and N) on yield are investigated. Soils are
	sampled regularly to follow changes in plant-available P and K.</p>

<p>
	<b>Design:</b> Four blocks of four plots (total of 16 plots, each 300m<sup>2</sup>)
	each testing the effects of permanent grass, rotational grass, arable
	and bare fallow, were established on a long-term grassland site (>100
	years). Two blocks are in winter wheat test crops each year whilst the
	other two are in treatment crops. Yields are no longer taken, but soils
	are taken about every 5 years. In 2008 two plots within each block were
	used to establish the Highfield Conversion Experiment (see below).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths:</b> It is the only site at Rothamsted available for studying
	the effects of converting long-term grass to arable and bare-fallow
	treatments, on SOC and fertility. It provides contrasting comparisons with

<p>
	<b>Background:</b> The Rothamsted <b>Highfield and Fosters Ley-Arable 
	experiments </b>started in autumn 1948. The two sites have the same soil type
	but the cropping histories of each are very different. Highfield had
	been in permanent grass since 1838 (Lawes & Gilbert, 1885); on this site some plots stayed in
	permanent grass, others went into continuous arable cropping and some
	alternated between leys and arable. In contrast, Fosters has been in
	arable cropping for several centuries; on this site some plots stayed
	in continuous arable, some went into permanent grass and others
	alternated between leys and arable. Although yields are no longer
	measured, SOM continues to be monitored. Even after more than 60 years,
	SOM contents on these experiments have still not reached new
	equilibria. In soils ploughed out of permanent grass, SOM is still
	declining whilst it continues to increase in soils under permanent
	grass.

<H2>Highfield Bare Fallow, Rothamsted</H2>

<p>
	In 1959 an area of permanent grass (since 1838, Lawes & Gilbert, 1885) adjacent to the
	Highfield Ley-Arable experiment at Rothamsted was ploughed, and has not
	grown a crop since. This is the <b>Highfield Bare Fallow</b>. It is
	kept free of weeds by frequent cultivation, but herbicides are used
	occasionally, so inputs of carbon to the soil are negligible. Soil
	organic carbon (SOC) is measured periodically, and this has declined
	substantially since the area was first ploughed out of grass.  Archived soil samples are available.

<p>
	<b>Design:</b> In 2008 two plots (continuous grass and arable) within

	arable and bare-fallow treatments within each. Adjacent long-term bare-fallow
	areas were also included in the experiment. Soil samples are taken
	regularly and yields are taken annually. Many archived samples are available.  
        Baseline soil measurements before the Conversion are given in Hirsch et al (2009);

        the effects of converting long-term grass to arable and bare-fallow treatments
        on SOC, fertility, soil resilience and recovery. The experiment has support from several groups within
	Rothamsted, providing a resource for multidisciplinary research, from 
        analytical chemistry, soil physical structure, GHG emissions and nitrification potential,
        microbial and mesofauna community responses to management change. It is probably unique in
	that it examines soil resilience and restoration through plants.

<p>
	<B>Current design:</b> Five year rotation of three years in arable
	crops or grass leys followed by two years of test crops (wheat and
	barley). Total of 80 plots divided into 5 blocks. Yields are recorded
	every year and one block is soil sampled each year. One block limed
	each year.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Strengths:</b> Cropping data and yields available since 1938. Soil
	samples available from 1938, and then every 5 years since the
	mid-1950s. Only long-term ley-arable cropping experiment based on the
	sandy loam at Woburn. Provides a comparison with the two ley-arable
	experiments at Rothamsted.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Background: </b> started in 1938 to compare the effects of rotations
	with or without grass or grass-clover leys on SOM and the yield of two
	arable test crops. Soils at Woburn that have been in continuous arable
	cropping since 1876 contain about 0.9 % C, and %C is still declining
	slowly; soils that have alternated between 3-year leys and 2-years
	arable since 1938 contain about 1.2 % C. Typically, where no fertilizer
	N is applied, grain yields of the first wheat test crop are greater
	following grass leys than in the continuous arable sequence because
	more N is available from the mineralisation of SOM. Following
	grass-clover leys, yield is increased further because of the extra N
	being made available from the breakdown of the leguminous residues.
	Following the leys, a larger yield is often achieved, with less
	fertilizer N, compared with continuous arable cropping.

<p>
	The <b>Market Garden experiment</b> started in 1942, originally to look
	at the effects on SOM and crop yield of various organic inputs; namely
	FYM, compost and sewage sludge. The experiment was grass from 1974 to
	1982. When concerns were expressed in the late 1970s about the heavy
	metal content of sewage sludges being applied to agricultural land, the
	experiment was “reactivated” to examine the fate of metals that had
	been applied in the sewage sludge between 1942 and 1961. More recently,
	the experiment has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of
	hyperaccumulator plants, i.e. plants that can naturally accumulate
	large amounts of metals from soils and which, potentially, could be
	used to “clean up” soils contaminated with heavy metals. Part of the
	experiment was physically moved in 2005 and in 2006 the whole
	experiment was sown to grass.

<H2>Woburn long-term sludge experiments</H2>

</div>
<p>
	The <b>Woburn long-term sludge experiments</b> were started in 1994, at
	Butt Close field, to study the effects of heavy metals contained in
	sewage sludges on soil fertility and microbial activity. They are part
	of a network of nine sites throughout the UK.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Design: </b>Three experiments in Butt Close field: 1) sewage cake
	experiment (CS/427), 2) liquid sludge experiment (CS/428), and 3) metal
	salts experiment (CS/439). Details can be found in Gibbs et al (2006
	a,b) and Chaudri et al (2008).
<p>
<p>
	<b>Experiment CS/427:</b> Five types of sewage sludge cake were
	applied, (including place of origin):
<UL>
	<li>Digested low metal sludge (D; Banbury)</li>
	<li>Digested sludges contaminated with either Zn (DZn; Coleshill)</li>
	<li>Digested sludges contaminated with either Cd (DCd; Perry Oaks)</li>
	<li>Undigested low metal sludge (U; Carterton)</li>
	<li>Undigested sludge contaminated with Cu (UCu; Selkirk)</li>
</UL>
</p>
<p>Sludges were applied in two different ways, as short-term (ST)
	treatments applied in four large applications between 1994 and 1997 or
	as long-term (LT) treatments of annual applications between 1994 and
	2014 of approximately 1/25th of the amounts of the same sludges to
	realize the same total dose of metal application as in the ST
	treatments in 25 years.</p>
<p>Note that U and D refer to the original sludge treatment process.
	After 1997, these sludges were air-dried and stored for use during the
	long-term treatment period. A control receiving no sludge was included
	in the experiment. Treatments randomised in 3 blocks 6 x 8 m in size.</p>

<p>
	<b>Experiments CS /428 and /439: </b> see below, and Gibbs et al (2006
	b) and Chaudri et al (2008).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths:</b> CS/427 enables comparison of different sewage sludge
	processing and metal concentrations and period of application (short
	term versus long-term) at four rates (ST treatments) up to EU limits
	for Zn, Cu and Cd in soils. All had the same amount of organic matter
	added. Wheat is grown and mineral fertilisers added every year. Samples
	of the sludge used and periodic soil and plant samples are available in
	the Rothamsted Sample Archive. This experiment is replicated on other
	soils in Gleadthorpe, Rosemaund, Bridgets and Hartwood.
</p>
<p>CS/428 and 439 are small plots (3.5 x 1.2 m) surrounded by boards for
	comparison of additions of the bulky ex-sewage works sludge in CS/427
	with respectively: a) small amounts of organic matter but the same
	amounts of metals in a specially made liquid sludge applied 1994-1997,
	or b) the same amounts of metals added as salts (no organic matter
	added).</p>

</div>
<p>
	<B>Current design:</B> A five year arable rotation (Wheat, Maize/C
	Crop, Rye, S.Barley/C Crop, Beans) with different organic amendments
	(FYM, Straw, Compost, None, permanent grass/clover leys). Total of 32
	plots divided into four blocks. Plots are split so that N can be
	applied at six rates for all crops, except beans which receive no N.
	Yields are recorded each year and soils are taken every 5 years. Total plot size
	8.83m x 8.0m Blocks 1, 2 and 4; 7.83m x 8.0m Block 3. N sub-plots are 4m wide. 

</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths:</B> Cropping data, yields and soils available since 1964.
	The experiment is randomized and has adequate replication. It is the
	only long-term organic manure experiment on the sandy loam at Woburn
	and the only long-term experiment including cover crop treatments.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Background</B>: Started in 1964 on the sandy loam soil at Woburn to
	test the effects of different types of organic matter inputs on soil
	organic matter (SOM) and crop yields. Initially six organic treatments
	(FYM, peat, straw, green manures and two grass leys) were compared with
	two fertilizer-only treatments. Arable crops were grown in rotation
	with an eight-level N test 1973-1980 to assess the effects of the
	increased levels of SOM achieved by the organic amendments. During this
	period, no organic manures were applied. There was another treatment
	phase from 1981-1986, when further organic manures were applied. Again,
	SOM increased with the organic treatments and the grass leys but
	continued to decline slowly where only fertilizers were applied. This
	treatment phase was followed by another test phase, 1987-1994, when six
	rates of N were tested on arable crops, and no further organic manures
	were applied. From 1995-2002 arable test cropping continued but only
	two rates of N were tested. In 2003 another treatment phase started.
	All plots, except for the permanent grass-clover leys (and beans when
	grown) were split to test six rates of N on arable crops grown in
	rotation.

</div>
<p>
	<B>Design: </B>Duplicate straw incorporation experiments were
	established at Great Knott III, Rothamsted and Far Field I, Woburn in
	1987; both are in continuous winter wheat: Rothamsted – Sixteen plots
	(each 40m<sup>2</sup>) in four blocks with different rates of straw
	incorporation (0, 1, 2 & 4 times normal straw yield). Woburn – twelve
	plots (each 43m<sup>2</sup>) in three blocks with different rates of
	straw incorporation (0, 1, 2 & 4 times normal straw yield). Yields of
	grain and straw are taken each year, and soil has been sampled after 7,
	11 and 22 years of contrasting straw treatments.
</p>

<P>
	<b>Strengths:</b> These experiments provide a comparison of soil
	organic matter dynamics in contrasting soil types, at Rothamsted (a
	silty clay loam) and at Woburn (a sandy loam). The experiments have
	been used recently for studies of soil structure and earthworm
	activity (see Sizmur et al, 2017 in Key Referenes below). 
	The findings at Rothamsted can be compared with those from
	section 0 on Broadbalk where straw is also incorporated.
</p>
<p>Yields will not be taken from these experiments in 2016 or 2017, but
	they will continue as a resource to be sampled. After harvest 2017 both
	experiments will be discontinued.</p>

		title="Rothamsted Continuous Maize, Hoosfield" width="675"

</div>
<p>
	<b>Design:</b> Continuous maize and barley plots with different amounts
	of maize tops incorporated. Total of 18 plots divided into three
	blocks. The experiment is duplicated at Rothamsted on a silty slay loam
	and Woburn on a sandy loam.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths: </b>The experiment has good replication. The experiments
	provide a comparison between different soil types (silty clay vs sandy
	loam). Maize is incorporated every year so that it has contributed
	significantly to the soil organic C (SOC) stock The incorporation of C4
	maize residues provides an opportunity to measure the contribution to
	the SOC from the maize and evaluate its turnover using <sup>13</sup>C
	stable isotope techniques. The plots are large (225-300m<sup>2</sup>)
	so could be divided to include additional treatments.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Background:</b> The experiments were started in 1997, one at
	Rothamsted (Hoosfield) and the other at Woburn (Stackyard). There were
	six crop and straw treatments: 1. Continuous maize, stubble
	incorporated; 2. Continuous maize, stubble plus 10t maize tops
	incorporated; 3. Maize after three years of spring barley, straw
	removed; 4. Spring barley after five years maize, stubble incorporated;
	5. Continuous spring barley, straw removed plus 10 t maize tops
	incorporated; 6. Continuous spring barley, straw removed. Crop yields
	were taken each year and soils were collected in 1997, 2008 and 2015.
	Maize and spring barley were chosen as crops with contrasting delta <sup>13</sup>C
	enrichment in their residues. This can be used to follow the fate of
	the C incorporated in the crop residues. The experiments were
	established initially for use in SOM fractionation studies, but staff
	and analytical funds are no longer available to support this work, so
	the experiment was discontinued in 2015.

	to monitor nutrient concentrations in soil solution under long-term
	grass at 10 and 50cm depth. Soil nutrient analyses from plot 3d are
	also included as part of the ECN data. In addition, weather variables
	are monitored on site using an automated weather station on an hourly
	and daily basis. Dry and Wet deposition of potential pollutants (SO<sub>4</sub>-S,
	NO<sub>3</sub>-N etc) and pH of rainfall are monitored at both sites
	(Rothamsted and North Wyke). Surface water chemistry of the river Ver
	is monitored at Rothamsted. Many of these variables are monitored on a
	weekly basis at both sites. Vegetation surveys and insect/animal
	surveys have been done regularly.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Strengths: </b>The Rothamsted ECN (Environmental Change Network)
	forms part of a wider network of twelve terrestrial sites in the UK in

<H2>Long-term liming, Rothamsted &amp; Woburn</H2>

<p>Two long-term liming experiments were started in 1962 at Rothamsted
	(Sawyers field) and Woburn (Stackyard) to study the interaction between
	soil pH, P and K on crop yields. The fields differ in soil type.
	Rothamsted is a flinty silty clay loam (Batcombe-Carstens Series) and
	Woburn is a sandy loam (Cottenham Series). Different amounts of lime
	(including zero) were applied from 1962 onwards to fields that had been
	acid for many years before the experiments began (Bolton, 1970). The
	original experimental design was four lime treatments with and without
	P and K (4 x 2 x 2 factorial with two replicates) within randomised
	blocks and with plot sizes of 6 m x 8 m. The experiments were modified
	in 1981 with 4 lime treatments and 4 P levels, but again only two
	replicates. One of the lime and one P treatment continued as
	&ldquo;zeros&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yields of various crops were recorded from 1962-1996 and papers
	published (Bolton, 1976, 1977 a,b; McEwen et al, 1990). Soil samples
	have been used for experiments determining the effects of pH on the
	bioavailability of heavy metals (Sanders et al, 1986). Lime was applied
	in one year (1962) and then in small doses between 1982-1987. The plots
	were also used as part of a dataset to produce the Rothamsted Lime
	Model (RothLime; Goulding et al, 1989) which was used from 1982 onwards
	to apply small amounts of lime to keep the plots at the target pHs
	(1:2.5 soil:water) of 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. Since 1997 the Rothamsted
	plots have been in grass; the Woburn experiment is now discontinued.</p>

<H2>Intensive cereals, Woburn</H2>

<p> These experiments are almost identical to the Broadbalk and Hoosfield Barley experiments at Rothamsted, but at Woburn. 
They are also known as the Woburn Continuous Wheat and Barley experiments. They started in 1876 on Woburn Stackyard, and where carried out by the Royal Agricultural
Society of England but with input from Lawes.  They were under continuous wheat and barley, mirroring the Broadbalk and Hoosfield Experiments, 
until 1926. According to Voelcker (1929), after 1926 it was decided to fallow the plots, which had become infested with weeds.  </p>

<p>Crop data available: Mean 10 year grain and straw yields are given by Johnson (1975) in t/ha.
Individual grain and total produce yields, for each year, 1877 - 1926 inclusive are given in the Appendix tables in Russell and Voelcker (1936).
Data is also available for total grain %N for most years from 1883 onwards (wheat and barley).      </p>
<p>Soil data available:  Soil %N, %C, pH, and Exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) were measured up to five times between 1876 and 1932. 
Blake et al (2003) used soil from the Continuous Barley experiment for soil P determination </p>
