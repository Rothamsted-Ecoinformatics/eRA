        "description": "The site was originally long-term arable (>100 years). Some plots stayed in permanent grass, others went into continuous arable cropping and some alternated between leys and arable. \n\nYields are no longer measured (since 1990) but SOM continues to be measured. Available P and K in soil have been measured periodically. \n\nThe main comparisons have been of four rotations, each of six years duration. The arable with lay rotation includes a one-year ley cut for hay. The other three have had three-year leys of different species and different management, followed by three arable crops and are referred to as 'test crops'.\n\nFosters Ley Arable runs in contrast to Highfield Ley Arable which has the same soil type but a different cropping history (having been in permanent grass for 100+ years) bot have similar treatments. It also provides a comparison to the Woburn Ley Arable experiment which has a different soil type.",
