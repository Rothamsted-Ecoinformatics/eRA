		Saxmundham Experimental Station is in East Suffolk, five miles (8 km) from the sea and 110 miles (177 km) East of Rothamsted. 
		The soil is a heavy sandy clay loam which can be difficult to cultivate, providing a contrast with the soils at Rothamsted and Woburn. Two long-term experiments were started in 1899 by East Suffolk County Council. Each consisted of four blocks so that a typical Norfolk four-course rotation could be grown, with each crop present each year. 
		Rothamsted assumed responsibility for the site in 1965 and the experiments were reviewed and modified. Rothamsted relinquished the site in 2010.</p>
