<h2>History</h2>

	
		<p>In 1899 two long-term experiments, Rotation I and Rotation II,
			were started at Saxmundham by the Education Committee of the East
			Suffolk County Council. Each consisted of four blocks so that a
			typical Norfolk four-course rotation could be grown, with each crop
			present each year. NAAS (now ADAS) managed the site from 1947 until
			1963, and when ARC (later AFRC, now BBSRC) acquired the lease in
			1964, Rothamsted assumed responsibility for managing the experimental
			programme, and the experiments were reviewed and modified. The
			reasons why the experiments were established, and early results are
			given by Oldershaw (1941).</p>
