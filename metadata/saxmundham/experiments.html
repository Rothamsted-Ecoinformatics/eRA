		<td><a href="experiment/srn1">S/RN/1</a></td>
		<td>Since 1965, to observe crop responses to P and K and their interactions with N, particularly with high rates of N applied to high yielding wheat cultivars for bread-making quality. From 1899-1964 to test combinations of N, P, K and organic manures on a typical four-course arable rotation. </td>

		<td>Saxmundham Rotation 2</td>
		<td><a href="experiment/srn2">S/RN/2</a></td>
		<td>Since 1965, to look at the response of various crops to fresh and residual soil P, and the decline in plant-available P when P fertilizer was no longer applied. From 1899 to 1964 to look at how limited amounts of FYM, sodium nitrate and superphosphate could best be used over a typical  four-course arable rotation.
