<h2>History</h2>

<p>
	Experiments began at Woburn in 1876 under the auspices of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. The principle aim was to test the residual manurial value of two contrasting feedstuffs fed to animals in covered yards or on the land. Rothamsted took over the management of the farm in the 1920s. <p>
	<p>Woburn Experimental Farm, despite the name, lies in the
	parish of Husborne Crawley and was previously known as Mill Farm due to
	its proximity to a watermill. Mill Farm was owned by the Duke of
	Bedford, who remains owner of the Experimental Farm.
</p>
<p>The last reference to a mill in Husborne Crawley in any directory for
	Bedfordshire is in 1869 and on the 1st edition Ordnance Survey map of
	1883 Mill Farm is shown but not the mill, suggesting that it was pulled
	down some time between these two dates, which was probably when today's
	Mill Farm house (a mid 19th century Bedford Estate structure) was
	built. Bedfordshire and Luton Archives and Records Service has a
	booklet on the history of the experimental farm written for its
	centenary in 1977 by A. E. Johnston. John Bennet Lawes (1814-1900) set
	up the Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden [Hertfordshire] in
	1843. Hastings, 9th Duke of Bedford was vice-president of the Royal
	Agricultural Society of England. He was interested in agricultural
	experimentation and offered a farm on the Woburn Estate on which to
	conduct experiments on the value of different types of animal manure on
	different types of soil. The Chemical Committee of the Royal
	Agricultural Society accepted and asked Lawes and his co-worker John
	Christopher Augustus Voelcker (1822-1884) to set up suitable
	experiments.</p>

<p>Mill Farm was selected as the place to carry out the trials but no
	single field was big enough and so the Duke also leased Stackyard Field
	from his tenant at Birchmore Farm, a mile away and on the west side of
	the road from Husborne Crawley to Woburn. When the tenant died
	Stackyard Field was added to Mill Farm and it remains part of the
	Experimental Farm to the present day [2021].</p>

<p>The Royal Agricultural Society became tenants of Stackyard Field and
	Mill Farm at Michaelmas 1876. The farm then comprised 67 acres of
	arable and 23 acres of grass; Stackyard Field was 26 acres. In
	Michaelmas 1879 Warren Field of 14 acres was added to Mill Farm. New
	feeding boxes for cattle were built at the farm at the Duke's expense
	in 1876 or 1877 and demolished in the early 1970s to make way for a
	potato store. The Duke of Bedford supported the Experimental Farm with
	money whenever it was needed and his successors George, the 10th Duke
	and Herbrand, the 11th Duke – the farm cost the successive dukes about
	£600 between 1876 and 1912, not an inconsiderable sum in those days.
	Lawes and Voelcker decided to take advantage of the light, sandy soils
	at Husborne Crawley in order to carry out experiments on the continuous
	growing of winter wheat and spring barley crops as well as their
	experiments with manure. They had already achieved the feat of
	continuous growing of crops on the heavy clay soil at Rothamsted. The
	first crops were harvested in 1877, the same year in which the manure
	experiments began. Lawes quickly became disenchanted with Husborne
	Crawley due to interference by the Royal Agricultural Society's
	Chemical Committee, now renamed the Woburn Committee and Voelcker
	carried on the work until his death in 1884 when he was succeeded by
	his son J. Augustus Voelcker (1854-1937).</p>

<p>In 1897 a laboratory was built at Husborne Crawley in which to test
	samples. This was made possible by a bequest of £10,000 by E. H. Hills,
	a member of a firm of chemical manufacturers which made artificial
	manure. This interesting building remains though it is now disused. The
	Development Act 1909 established a permanent Development Commission.
	One of its tasks was to increase productivity of land and one of its
	commissioners was the Director of Rothamsted. The Royal Agricultural
	Society thus received £2,900,000 per annum until 1915 and as a result
	the 11th Duke decided that he could withdraw his financial support from
	the Experimental Farm and a grant of £500 per annum was secured from
	1912 onwards. In 1915 there was a long debate about whether to
	terminate the experiments but the idea was rejected.</P>
<p>By 1917 German U-boats were sinking alarming quantities of allied
	shipping, so much so that it was feared that Britain would be starved
	into submission. As a panic measure War Agricultural Executive
	Committees in each county were told to order quantities of ancient
	pasture to be ploughed up and used for arable crops. This alienated
	local farmers who feared that they would make a loss because the crops
	grown would be likely to be less than on proper arable land and,
	meanwhile, they would loose valuable grazing for their cattle or sheep.
	The Royal Agricultural Society was ordered to plough up 14.5 acres at
	Husborne Crawley including Great Hill Bottom [WW1/AC/OP2/111]. After
	cropping the society put in a claim for loss but this was unsuccessful
	as the profit made on one field was greater than the loss made on the
	other. In the end the introduction of the convoy system greatly
	decreased the effectiveness of the German submarines and the emergency
	measures were discontinued.</p>
At Michaelmas 1921 the Royal Agricultural Society terminated its tenancy
of Mill Farm in order to save money. Voelcker, however, wished to
continue his work at Husborne Crawley and arranged to become the tenant
in October 1921. Live and dead stock at the farm were sold and realised
£635 [SF75/25]. The £500 grant to the Experimental Farm from government
continued provided that some body succeeded the Royal Agricultural
Society in a supervisory role. The obvious choice was the new governing
body for Rothamsted, the Lawes Agricultural Trust. Voelcker gave up the
tenancy of the farm in October 1926, he had spent around £2,000 in
maintaining his work; the Trust became the new tenants. Voelcker
continued to be Honorary Local Director until 1936.

<p>The Rating and Valuation Act 1925 specified that every building and
	piece of land in the country was to be assessed to determine its
	rateable value. The valuer visited the Experimental Farm [DV1/H5/12] on
	12th November 1926, just after the Lawes Agricultural Trust had taken
	over the tenancy. It paid rent of £160/10/- to the Duke of Bedford, set
	in 1921, the pre-war rent having been £120. The valuer calculated the
	area of the farm as 131 acres. Water was laid on but there was no
	electricity, lighting being by lamps. Sanitation was to a cesspool. The
	valuer noted: "Saw Mr. A. W. Greenhill of Lawes Agricultural Trust.
	Tenant's manager is Atkinson of Heather Lea, Woburn Sands This farm is
	an experimental test farm probably run at considerable loss". The
	farmhouse comprised two living rooms, a kitchen, an office, a pantry
	and two cellars under the ground floor. Four bedrooms stood on the
	first floor, along with a boxroom, a bathroom, a W. C., a coal shed and
	a wood barn.</p>

<p>The Farm buildings comprised:</p>
<p>
	<b>South Block A:</b> a large store room; an experimental drying room;
	a specimen room; a brick, wood and slate garage and a granary with a
	loft over;
</p>
<p>
	<b>Separate Block B:</b> a laboratory, an office and storeroom; a pot
	culture station; a glasshouse and a cage. Water was laid on;
</p>
<p>
	<b>West Block C:</b> a wood and corrugated iron cattle weighing bridge;
	a brick and slate mixing house; a pig house with three fattening pens
	and a two bay open cowshed;
</p>
<p>
	<b>North Block D:</b> a carthorse stable for six; a chaff house; a wood
	and corrugated iron three bay open implement shed; a lean-to brick and
	corrugated iron engine shed containing an eight horsepower oil engine
	driving the chaff cutter etc.; a brick and slate barn with loft over
	and another chaffhouse;
</p>
<p>
	<b>East Block E:</b> a brick and slate cowhouse for six cows used as a
	piggery; two loose boxes and two semi-covered corrugated iron yards;
</p>
<p>
	<b>Separate North Block F:</b> a wood and tiled four bay open cart
	shed; a brick and slate mixing house and an experimental cattle feeding
	house containing eight loose boxes with central feeding passage.
</p>
<p>The valuer commented: "Buildings in good order. Farm runs as
	Experimental Station probably at considerable loss: is rather a show
	place and calls itself "The Woburn Agricultural Test Farm".</p>

<p>On J. Augustus Voelcker's retirement as Honorary Local Director in
	1936 Harold Hart Mann (1872-1961) took over supervision of the field
	experiments and laboratory work and Tom W. Barnes (1901-1974) was
	appointed as chemist in 1928. Mann took sole charge of the farm in
	1936. He retired in 1956 and was replaced by C. A. Thorold until 1968
	when he retired. The Dairy Farm of 17.5 hectares was transferred to the
	Experimental farm by the Bedford Estate in 1962 as, were two more
	fields: Horsepool Lane Close of just over eight acres in 1971 and Far
	Field of about nine acres in 1972.</p>
