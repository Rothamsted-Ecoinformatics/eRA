<H1>Exhaustion Land Experiment Soils</H1>
<p>The Exhaustion Land experiment was started in 1856 on a site on Hoosfield, which has probably been occupied since Roman times. The Rothamsted map of 1623 shows 
the site under arable cultivation. Unmanured winter wheat was grown 1852-1855 (Johnston & Poulton, 1977). Here, details are given of the site and the soil.</p>

<b>Soil texture class: </b> Silty clay loam topsoil over clay-with–flints (Avery & Catt, 1995). The soil contains a large number of flints and some rounded pebbles from the 
material derived from the Reading Beds. The soil is naturally acid and free draining. Below about 2m depth the soil becomes chalk. </p>

<li>Sand:	28 %</li>
<li>Silt:	52 %</li>
<li>Clay (<2 &micro;m):	20 %</li>

<p>Typical Batcombe-Carsten series topsoil contains 18-27% clay, with more clay at depth (Avery & Catt 1995). </p>

<p><b>Soil pH:</b> Since the 1950s, chalk (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) has been applied as necessary to maintain a minimum soil pH of 7.0. Like several other old arable fields at Rothamsted, 
Hoosfield was given large dressings of chalk in the early 19th century, when the practice was to dig out the underlying chalk and spread it on the arable land. 
Chalk was applied at up to 250 t/ha, and this increased topsoil pH in water (23cm) to between 7.0 and 8.0 (from Poulton <i>et al</i>, 2013).
