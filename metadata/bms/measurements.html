		<h2>Meteorological data available in BROOMET</h2>

		<p>Daily meteorological data recorded at Brooms Barn, Higham, Bury
			St Edmunds, Suffolk available since 1982. Manual observations ceased
			in 1996 (apart from sunshine) and meteorological records are now
			measured by a range of sensors attached to an automatic data logger
			(CR1000). Between August 2009 and May 2012 the weather station was
			not fully functional, and raw data supplied by the Brooms Barn Met
			Office weather station was used for some variables. The faulty
			sensors were replaced 23 May 2012, new dataloggers installed 12-13
			December 2012.</p>
		<p>
			Hourly data from 2016 (radiation from 2003) is available from the <a
