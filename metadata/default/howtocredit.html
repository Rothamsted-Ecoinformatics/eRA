		<p>The published datasets from Rothamsted's Long-term Experiments are important scientific research outputs from these experiments and must be properly cited if re-used or referred to in any publication or other output.</p> 
		<p>Correct dataset citations:</p>
		<ul>
		<li class="mb-2">formally acknowledges the author's sources</li>
		<li class="mb-2">makes finding source data easier</li>
		<li class="mb-2">supports reproducible research</li>
		<li class="mb-2">allows the impact of datasets to be tracked and reported</li>
		<li class="mb-2">provides a structure which recognises data creators and curators</li>
		<p>All published datasets on e-RA are provided with a DataCite Digital Object Identifier (DOI).</p> 
		<p>You must ensure the dataset is correctly cited and includes the dataset DOI, either where it is presented or in the reference list of any publications, reports or other outputs which use this dataset in whole or in part. Correct citation of datasets helps us to monitor their use and report their continuing impact to funders.
		An example of a recommended citation is:</p>
		<blockquote>Margaret Glendining (2018). Broadbalk Soil Total % Nitrogen Content, 1843-2010 <i>Electronic Rothamsted Archive, Rothamsted Research</i> 10.23637/BK-oadata-soilN-01</blockquote> 
		<p>Where the data is presented, either in original or derived form, such as a graphic or table, in addition to using the citation above, you must always use the following attribution statement to acknowledge the source of the information:</p>
		<i>Contains data supplied by Rothamsted Research.</i>
