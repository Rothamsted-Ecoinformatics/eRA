		The data in e-RA are subject to rigorous quality control procedures
		from the point of collection in the field to entry into the database.
		Full details of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) followed to
		ensure data quality control can be obtained from the e-RA Curators <a

	<h1>Sample collection procedures</h1>

	<p>
		Standard procedures are followed for sample collection by combine
		harvester<sup>1</sup>, sample processing<sup>2</sup>, dealing with
		harvest samples and preparing them for analysis<sup>3</sup>, and
		details of additional samples from the Classical Experiments to be
		kept for archiving<sup>4</sup>.
	</p>

	<h1>Downloading met data</h1>

	<p>
		A Standard Operating Procedure is followed for downloading the
		meteorological data from Rothamsted and Woburn [and Brooms Barn? The docport link to SOPs no longer works] automatic weather
		stations. The calculations of the derived variables for
		the meteorological data are done by standard formulae, embedded in
		excel spreadsheets.[This needs updating. Link to derived formula]
	</p>

	<h1>Data checking procedure</h1>

	<p>
		Until 2019, to ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were
		typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second
		typing (known as verification) the data values were compared with those
		typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved
		before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to
		handle situations where the written records were illegible or
		ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be
		very inaccurate. Once the data are entered into e-RA, they were
		independently back-checked against the original data sheets<sup>6</sup>.
	</P>
		<p>Since 2020, the is no longer any routine manual data entry, as most records are now in electronic form. 
		New datasets, including annual updates to existing datasets, are independently back-checked with the original data source. </p>
	
	<h1>Quality control of meteorological data</h1>
	<p>All equipment, including the datalogger, is checked, serviced and calibrated annually at 
	Rothamsted, Woburn and Brooms Barn by Campbell Scientific Ltd. 
	The Test Equipment used in the Campbell Scientific calibration/maintenance process are registered 
	on an in-house Calibration/Maintenance database. The Test Equipment is either calibrated to 
	National Standards by a UKAS accredited laboratory, or are calibrated in-house using instruments 
	which have themselves been calibrated by a UKAS accredited laboratory. Hence, all equipment calibrated/maintained 
	by Campbell Scientific Ltd is traceable to these standards. </p>
