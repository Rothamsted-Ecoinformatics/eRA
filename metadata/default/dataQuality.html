		In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at
		Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating
		procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in
		the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. Full details of
		the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) followed to ensure data
		quality control can be obtained from the <a
			href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Sample collection procedures</h3>

	<p>Standard Operating Procedures are followed for sample collection
		by combine harvester, sample processing, dealing with harvest samples
		and preparing them for analysis, and details of additional samples
		from the Classical Experiments to be kept for archiving.</p>



	<h3>Data checking procedures</h3>

	<p>Until 2019, to ensure quality control during data inputting, the
		data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry).
		During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared
		with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were
		resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out
		how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or
		ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can
		be very inaccurate. Once the data are entered into e-RA, they were
		independently back-checked against the original data sheets. They are
		also subject to consistency checks embedded within e-RA.</P>

	<p>Since 2020, there is no longer any routine manual data entry, as
		most records are now in electronic form. New datasets, and annual
		updates to existing datasets, are independently back-checked with the
		original data source. They are also subject to consistency checks
		embedded within e-RA.</p>

	<h3>Downloading meteorological data</h3>

	<p>
		Standard Operating Procedures are followed for downloading the
		meteorological data from Rothamsted, Woburn and Brooms Barn automatic
		weather stations. The calculations of the derived variables are by
		standard formulae, embedded in e-RA (see <a
			href="info/met/derived_variables"> derived variables<a>).
				There is also a SOP to follow for measurement of precipitation at
				times of snowfall (turf wall enclosure), as heavy snowfall can block
				the ARG100 rain guage. 
	</p>



	<h3>Quality control of meteorological data</h3>
	<p>All equipment, including the datalogger, is checked, serviced
		and calibrated annually at Rothamsted, Woburn and Brooms Barn by
		Campbell Scientific Ltd. The Test Equipment used in the Campbell
		Scientific calibration/maintenance process are registered on an
		in-house Calibration/Maintenance database. The Test Equipment is
		either calibrated to National Standards by a UKAS accredited
		laboratory, or are calibrated in-house using instruments which have
		themselves been calibrated by a UKAS accredited laboratory. Hence, all
		equipment calibrated/maintained by Campbell Scientific Ltd is
		traceable to these standards.</p>
	<p>The data are also subject to consistency checks embedded within
		e-RA.
