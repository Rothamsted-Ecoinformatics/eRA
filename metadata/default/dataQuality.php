	<h1>Data quality in e-RA</h1>

	<p>
		The data in e-RA are subject to rigorous quality control procedures
		from the point of collection in the field to entry into the database.
		Full details of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) followed to
		ensure data quality control can be obtained from the e-RA Curators <a
			href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators</a>.
	</p>

	<h1>Sample collection procedures</h1>

	<p>
		Standard procedures are followed for sample collection by combine
		harvester<sup>1</sup>, sample processing<sup>2</sup>, dealing with
		harvest samples and preparing them for analysis<sup>3</sup>, and
		details of additional samples from the Classical Experiments to be
		kept for archiving<sup>4</sup>.
	</p>

	<h1>Downloading met data</h1>

	<p>
		A Standard Operating Procedure is followed for downloading the
		meteorological data from Rothamsted and Woburn automatic weather
		stations<sup>5</sup>. The calculations of the derived variables for
		the meteorological data are done by standard formulae, embedded in
		excel spreadsheets.
	</p>

	<h1>Data checking procedure</h1>

	<p>
		To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets are
		typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second
		typing (known as verification) the data values are compared with those
		typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies are resolved
		before verification continues. This procedure also sets out how to
		handle situations where the written records are illegible or
		ambiguous. This procedure avoids visual checking of data, which can be
		very inaccurate. Once the data are entered into e-RA, they are
		independently back-checked against the original data sheets<sup>6</sup>.
