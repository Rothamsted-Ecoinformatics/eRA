		<h2>Open Access Datasets</h2>

		<p>Open Access datasets (OAD) are downloaded without registration
			or a password and provide averaged data with accompanying metadata
			and descriptions.</p>
		<p>Long-term Experiment (LTE) OAD provide a simplified or summary
			overview of key data, findings, trends, or changes in the data
			averaged across a number of plots and years.</p>
		<p>Meteorological (met) data OAD present hourly and daily data
			averaged to monthly or annual values.</p>
		<p>For more detailed plot or daily data you should look for a
			Registration dataset or access to the e-RA database.</p>
		<p>OAD are published with a citable DOI (a permanent unique
			identifier for a dataset) and are free to use under a CC-BY-4.0
			license, therefore if you use the dataset you must give appropriate
			credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which
			includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the dataset must
			also be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research
			endorses the user or the use.</p>
		<p>
			Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a href="info/conditions">Conditions of Use</a> and must
			agree to these
			conditions.

		<h3>How can I find Open Access Datasets?</h3>
		<p>
			These datasets are grouped by their LTE or meteorological station.
			You can find datasets either under the <i>Experiment
				Data/Meteorological Data</i> menu item above and following a link for an
			LTE or met station, which will display all relevant published
			datasets for that LTE or met station. Alternatively, under the <i>Experiments</i>
			menu item above, follow a link to an LTE or met station then click
			the <i>Datasets</i> tab. This will display the same list of published

		<h2>Registration Datasets</h2>
		<p>
			Registration datasets can be downloaded once completing a <a href="newUser.php">simple registration
				form</a>. They provide data
			at the spatial and temporal resolution at which it was collected. The
			data is not normally averaged.
		</p>
		<p>For LTE data, registration datasets provide access to observed
			and measured data values from individual plots for each year data has
			been collected. For met data, registration datasets provide data at
			recorded daily resolutions.</p>
		<p>
			These are curated datasets accompanied by detailed metadata and
			supporting documentation to support interpretation and re-use by
			dataset users. However, while the e-RA curators have made every
			effort to provide sufficient documentation to allow users to
			independently use these datasets, users are still strongly encouraged
			to contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA
				Data Curators</a> for support if needed.
		</p>
		<p>These datasets are published with a citable DOI and are free to
			use under CC-BY-4.0 license. Users of these datasets must give
			appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation

	<div class="row  m-3">
		<p>Registration is free and we ask you to register for the
			following reasons:</p>


		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">It helps us to understand who is using the
				data and how.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">It allows us to measure the use and impact of
				the LTE data and report to our funder, the UK Biotechnology and
				Biological Sciences Research Council. Demonstrating continuing use
				and impact helps to ensure this data resource continues to be funded
				and the data remain accessible.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">This information helps us to prioritise data
				curation activities.</li>
