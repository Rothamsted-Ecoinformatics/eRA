		<h2>Open Access Datasets</h2>
		
		<p>Open Access datasets can be freely downloaded and provide access to data that has been
			averaged across a number of years or plots.</p> 
		<p>For LTE data Open Access datasets provide a simplified or summary overview of key
			findings, trends or changes in the data. For more detailed annual plot data you should look for a registration datasets.</p>
		<p>For meteorological data, Open Access datasets average hourly and daily data to monthly or annual values.</p>
		<p>Open Access are published with a citable DOI (a
			permanent unique identifier for a dataset) and are free to use under
			a CC-BY-4.0 license, therefore if you use the dataset you must give appropriate
			credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which
			includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the dataset must also be
			indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research endorses
			the user or the use.</p>
		<p>
			Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a
				href="conditions.php">Conditions of Use</a> and must agree to these
			conditions.
		</p>

		<h3>How can I find Open Access Datasets?</h3>
		<p>
			These datasets are grouped by their Long-term Experiments. You can
			find datasets either under the <i>Data</i> menu item above and
			following a link for an LTE. This will display all published datasets
			for that LTE. Alternatively under the <i>Experiments</i> menu item
			above, follow a link to an LTE then click the <i>datasets</i> tab.
			This will display the same list of published datasets.

		<h2>Registration Datasets</h2>
		<p>Registration datasets provide data at the spatial and temporal
			resolution at which it was collected. The data is not normally averaged.</p>
		<p>For LTE data, registration datasets provide access to observed
			and measured data values from individual plots for each year data has
			been collected. For meteorological data registration datasets
			provide data at recorded daily and hourly resolutions.</p>
		<p>
			These are curated datasets accompanied by detailed metadata and
			supporting documentation to support interpretation and re-use by
			dataset users. However, while the e-RA curators have made every
			effort to provide sufficient documentation to allow users to
			independently use these datasets, users are still strongly encouraged
			to contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA
				Data Curators</a> for support if needed.
		</p>
		<p>For LTEs, the data provided in the published registration
			datasets may represent a subset of experimental treatments, crops or
			plots for an LTE. If this is the case, the data included is determined by the LTE data
			curators using the following criteria:</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">Sufficient documentation exists to
				support interpretation and re-use of the data.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Continuity of experiment treatments.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Usefulness, importance, relevance
				and/or comparability of an experiment treatment to other treatments
				in the LTE or other LTEs.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Popularity based on previous use and
				requests for research.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="row m-3">
		<p>Data is excluded from the published datasets if:</p>

	<div class="row  m-3">
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">There is insufficient documentation
				to support interpretation and re-use of the data.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">A plot does not have continuity of
				treatments over time.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">The treatments do not have relevance or
				comparability to other experiment treatments.</li>

		<p>

		<p>Annual plot datasets datasets are published with a citable DOI
			and are free to use under CC-BY-4.0 license. Users of these datasets
			must give appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided

		<h3>Why do I need to register to access some published datasets</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<p>Registration is free and we ask you to register for the following reasons:</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">It helps us to understand who is
				using the data and how.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">It allows us to measure the use and
				impact of the LTE data and report to our funder, the UK
				Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
				Demonstrating continuing use and impact helps to ensure this data
				resource continues to be funded and the data remain accessible.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">This information helps us to
				prioritise data curation activities.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">You can opt in to receive updates for
				the datasets you use.</li>

		<h3>How does registration work?</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<p>For published datasets we aim to make the registration process
			as simple as possible.</p>
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">Complete the registration form. Most
				questions are optional but you must enter an email.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">To confirm your email is valid, a
				validation email will be sent to you with a confirmation link.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Clicking the email confirmation link
				will validate your email and you can now download datasets.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">The e-RA website uses cookies to
				remember you until you either log out or your session expires
				(session remains active a month).</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">When you next visit e-RA afyer your

		<h2>Request only access to the e-RA database.</h2>

		<p>The e-RA database provides access to additional LTE data. The
			database is accessible online using the password protected e-RA data
			extraction tool. Access is provided to researchers requesting access
			to data in specific datasets not included in published datasets.</p>
		<p>Before requesting access to the e-RA database, please review
			the published datasets as these provide the most widely useful and
			usabel e-RA data.</p>
		<p>We do not publish all data for a number of reasons including:</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">A plot does not have continuity of
				treatments over time.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">The treatments do not have relevance
				or comparability to other experiment treatments.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">The data is not well enough
				described or is still in preparation.</li>

		<h3>How do I request access to the e-RA database?</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<p>To request access please complete the following form [IN
			PREPARATION].</p>
		<p>after you submit your request the e-RA Data Curators will
			contact you to identify the right data for your research question.</p>
		<p>Please note, if your request requires significant support and
			time from the e-RA curators to help in the interpretation or
			preparation of datasets we may either request co-authorship in any
			research publications. For large commercial requests we charge a fee
			to cover staff time for preparing a dataset.</p>
