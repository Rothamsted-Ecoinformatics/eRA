		<p>e-RA provides three access to three different data products from the Rothamsted Long-term Experiments National Capability. 
		The data provide either data in either summary (aggregated) form, for example, average grain yield per treatment or 
		as individual data points (disaggregated) at the spatial and temporal resolution recorded, for example grain yield per plot per year. The three data products are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="mb-2">Published aggregated datasets</li>
			<li class="mb-2">Published disaggregated datasets</li>
			<li class="mb-2">Request only access to the e-RA database (disaggregated data)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="row p-3 m-3">
		<h2>Published aggregated datasets</h2>
		<p>Aggregated datasets provide access to data that has been averaged across a number of years or plots such that data values from an individual plot or year cannot be determined. 
		For LTE data, aggregated datasets provide a simplified or summary overview of key findings, trends or changes in the data. 
		For meteorological data, aggregated datasets average hourly and daily data to monthly or annual values.
		</p>
		<p>Aggregated datasets are published with a citable DOI (a permanent unique identifier for a dataset) and are free to use under a CC-BY-4.0 license. Users of these datasets must give appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the dataset must be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research endorses the user or the use.
		</p>
		<p>Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a href="conditions.php">Conditions of Use</a> and must agree to these conditions.

		<h3>How can I find Published Aggregated Datasets?</h3>
		<p>These datasets are grouped by their Long-term Experiments. You can find datasets either under the <i>Data</i> menu item above and following a link for an LTE. This will display all published datasets for that LTE. Alternatively under the <i>Experiments</i> menu item above, follow a link to an LTE then click the <i>datasets</i> tab. This will display the same list of published datasets.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row p-3 m-3">
		<h2>Published disaggregated datasets</h2>
		<p>Disaggregated datasets provide data at the spatial and temporal resolution at which it was collected. The data is not averaged.
		</p>
		<p>For LTE data disaggregated datasets provide access to observed and measured data values from individual plots for each year data has been collected. 
		For meteorological data disaggregated datasets provide data at recorded daily and hourly resolutions.
		</p>
		<p>These are curated datasets accompanied by detailed metadata and supporting documentation to support interpretation and re-use by dataset users. 
		However, while the e-RA curators have made every effort to provide sufficient documentation to allow users to independently use these datasets, 
		users are still strongly encouraged to contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA Data Curators</a> for support if needed. 
		</p>
		<p>For LTEs, the data provided in the published disaggregated datasets may represent a subset of experimental treatments, crops or plots for an LTE. 
		The data included is determined by the LTE data curators using the following criteria:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="mb-2">Sufficient documentation exists to support interpretation and re-use of the data.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">Continuity of experiment treatments.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">Usefulness, importance, relevance and/or comparability of an experiment treatment to other treatments in the LTE or other LTEs.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">Popularity based on previous use and requests for research.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Data is excluded from the published datasets if:</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="mb-2">There is insufficient documentation to support interpretation and re-use of the data.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">A plot does not have continuity of treatments over time.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">The treatments do not have relevance or comparability to other experiment treatments.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">The data is not yet digitised or is still in preparation.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The digitised data not included in published aggregrated datasets is <a href="#database">accessible from the e-RA database</a> on request.
		</p>
		<p>Annual plot datasets datasets are published with a citable DOI and are free to use under CC-BY-4.0 license. 
		Users of these datasets must give appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which includes the DOI. 
		Any reasonable changes made to the datasets must be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research endorses the user or the use.

		</p>
		<p>To access these datasets we ask you to complete a simple registration form.
		</p>

		<h3>Why do I need to register to access some published datasets</h3>
		<p>Registration is free. We only ask you to register to access disaggregated data. You do not need to register for summary data.
		</p>
		<p>We ask you to register for the following reasons:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="mb-2">It helps us to understand who is using the data and how.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">It allows us to measure the use and impact of the LTE data and report to our funder, the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Demonstrating continuing use and impact helps to ensure this data resource continues to be funded and the data remain accessible.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">This information helps us to prioritise data curation activities.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">You can opt in to receive updates for the datasets you use.</li> 
		</ol>
		
		<h3>How does registration work?</h3>
		<p>For published datasets we aim to make the registration process as simple as possible.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Complete the registration form. Most questions are optional but you must enter an email.</li>
			<li>To confirm your email is valid, a validation email will be sent to you with a confirmation link.</li>
			<li>Clicking the email confirmation link will validate your email and you can now download datasets.</li>
			<li>The e-RA website uses cookies to remember you until you either log out or your session expires.</li>
			<li>When you next visit e-RA, login using your email and a validation email will be sent with a login link - this method means you don't need a password, just your email</li>

		<h2>Request only access to the e-RA database.</h2> 
		
		<p>The e-RA database provides access to additional LTE data. The database is accessible online using the password protected e-RA data extraction tool. 
		Access is provided to researchers requesting access to data in specific datasets not included in published datasets.
		</p>
		<p>Before requesting access to the e-RA database, please review the published datasets as these provide the most widely useful and usabel e-RA data.
		</p>
		<p>We do not publish all data for a number of reasons including:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li class="mb-2">A plot does not have continuity of treatments over time.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">The treatments do not have relevance or comparability to other experiment treatments.</li>
			<li class="mb-2">The data is not well enough described or is still in preparation.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>How do I request access to the e-RA database?</h3>
		
		<p>To request access please complete the following form [LINK NEEDED].
		</p>
		<p>after you submit your request the e-RA Data Curators will contact you to identify the right data for your research question.
		</p>
		<p>Please note, if your request requires significant support and time from the e-RA curators to help in the interpretation or preparation of datasets we may either request co-authorship in any research publications. For large commercial requests we charge a fee to cover staff time for preparing a dataset.
