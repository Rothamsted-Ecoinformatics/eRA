		<h2>Open Access Datasets (OADs)</h2>
		<p>
			These are curated datasets accompanied by  metadata and
			supporting documentation to support interpretation and re-use by
			dataset users. However, while the e-RA curators have made every
			effort to provide sufficient documentation to allow users to
			independently use these datasets, users are still strongly encouraged
			to contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA
				Data Curators</a> for support if needed.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Summary OADs</strong> provide averaged or selected data with some accompanying metadata
			and descriptions in a simple .xlsx file. These provide a summary
			overview of key data, findings, trends, or changes in the data
			averaged across a restricted number of plots and/or years. Both LTE and met data are in this format. Meteorological (met) data  present  daily data
			averaged to monthly or annual values.</p>
		<p><strong>Complete OADs </strong>provide comprehensive data with full metadata contained in a <em><strong>frictionless</strong></em> file format (both .xlsx and machine readable). 
		These provide all plots and years relating to a distinct period of time in an LTE,  with treatments, 
		agronomic information and yields provided. Currently only LTE data is provided in this format.</p>
		<p>All OADs are published with a citable DOI (a permanent unique
			identifier for a dataset) and are free to use under a CC-BY-4.0
			license, therefore if you use the dataset you must give appropriate
			credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which
			includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the dataset must
			also be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research
		endorses the user or the use.</p>
<p>
		Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a href="info/conditions">Conditions of Use</a> and must
			adhere to these
			conditions.

	</div>
	<div class="row  m-3">
		<p>All LTE data is gradually being converted to Open Access Datasets, it is an ongoing process.</p>
	  <p>For LTEs, the data provided in the OA 
			datasets may represent a subset of experimental treatments, crops or
			plots for an LTE. If this is the case, the data included is
			determined by the LTE data curators using the following criteria:</p>
		<ol>
			<li class=" mb-2">Sufficient documentation exists to support
				interpretation and re-use of the data.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Usefulness, importance, relevance and/or
				comparability of an experiment treatment to other treatments in the
			LTE or other LTEs.</li>
			<li class=" mb-2">Popularity based on previous use and requests
				for research.</li>
		</ol>
	
	
		<p>The digitised original data not included in published
		 datasets is accessible from e-RAdata on request for
			access.</p>
		<p>The daily met data is accesible from <b>e-RAdata</b>, and is updated on a daily basis. </p>

		<h3>How can I find Open Access Datasets?</h3>
		<p>
			These datasets are grouped by their LTE or meteorological station.
			You can find datasets either under the <i>Experiment
				Data/Meteorological Data</i> menu item above and following a link for an
			LTE or met station, which will display all relevant published
			datasets for that LTE or met station. Alternatively, under the <i>Experiments</i>
			menu item above, follow a link to an LTE or met station then click
			the <i>Datasets</i> tab. This will display the same list of published
			datasets.

			<li class=" mb-2">It allows us to measure the use and impact of

		<h2>e-RAdata</h2>

		<p>
			e-RAdata, the e-RA database, provides access to original LTE and daily meteorological
			data, once a <b>Request access to e-RAdata</b> form has been completed. The database is accessible online using
			the password protected e-RA data extraction tool. 
		</p>
		<p>Before requesting access to the e-RA database, please review
			the published datasets as these provide many of the most widely
			useful and usable e-RA data.</p>
	
		<p>
			To request access please complete the <a href="newGold.php">Request
				access to e-RAdata</a> form.
		</p>
		<p>After you submit your request the e-RA Data Curators will provide a password and may contact you to identify the right data for your research question.</p>
		<p>Please note, if your request requires significant support and
			time from the e-RA Curators to help in the interpretation or
			preparation of datasets we may request co-authorship in any research
			publications. For large commercial requests we charge a fee to cover
			staff time for preparing a dataset.</p>
