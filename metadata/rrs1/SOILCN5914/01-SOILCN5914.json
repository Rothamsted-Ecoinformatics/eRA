The data set contains SOC and total N as % and soil stock data, soil weights and soil pH in the topsoil (0-23cm)."

Samples were analysed for %N by the Kjeldahl method (Bremner, 1965), 1959-1987, and by LECO combustion, based on the Dumas method, 2000-2014.  SOC was measured by the Tinsley method (Kalembasa & Jenkinson, 1973) 1959-1987, and as total C by combustion (LECO) minus CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C by manometry, 2000-2014. Soil weights were measured in 1978 and 2000 and also in 2000 from an adjacent area of grassland, to give an estimate of starting value in 1959. Stocks of SOC and total N were calculated from %SOC and %N and estimated soil weight, 0-23cm."
