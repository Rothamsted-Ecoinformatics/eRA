<h2>Hoosfield Crop Nutrient Content</h2>
<p>The Hoosfield experiment was started in 1852 to investigate the
	relative importance of the plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus,
	potassium, magnesium and sodium (N, P, K, Mg and Na) and silicate (Si),
	applied as either fertilizer or manures, on the yield of spring barley.
	From the start of the experiment, samples of barley grain and straw
	were kept for chemical analysis, although straw samples from the 19th
	Century are limited.</p>


<h3>
	<strong>Early analysis</strong>
</h3>
<p>Lawes and Gilbert (1857) reported on yield and %N for the first
	six years of the experiment, and Gilbert (1893) on yield and grain
	composition for the first 30 years.</p>
<p>Hall and Morrison (1906) and Fisher (1929) reported on the
	effects of silica on yield.</p>

<p>Russell and Watson (1939) comprehensively discuss the effects of
	the different plant nutrients and FYM on composition and quality of
	barley grain from 1852-1937. Yates and Watson (1939) also published
	data on crop N content.</p>

<p>
	Warren and Johnston (1967) compared N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na content in
	grain and straw of the old variety Plumage Archer and the modern
	variety Maris Badger, in 1964 and 1966. This data is available in the
	dataset <b>HFBNUTRI</b>. They also report on the effects of sodium
	silicate on P%.
</p>
<p>The whole experiment was fallowed in 1912, 1933, 1943 and 1967.</p>


<h3>
	<strong>1968 to present</strong>
</h3>
<p>In 1968 some of the Hoosfield plots (subsequently called the
	"Main" plots) were divided into four sub-plots, to test four rates of
	N. Two three-course rotations with barley, potatoes and beans were
	started on Series AA and C of the experiment; plots were divided into
	16 sub-sub-plots to accommodate the different crops and four rates of
	N. The rotations continued until 1978.</p>

<p>
	No barley grain or straw was analysed for nutrient content in 1968 or
	1969. From 1970 onwards grain samples were analysed for total N every
	year. On the Main plots straw was also analysed, and in most years, P,
	K, Ca, Mg, Na were also determined. Sulphur (S) concentrations in grain
	and straw have been determined since 1996. See <a

</p>

<p>Leigh and Johnston (1983, 1985 and 1986) published a series of
	papers looking at N, P and K in dry matter and tissue water on the
	Hoosfield barley crops.</p>

<p>15N-labelled fertilizer was applied to plots of contrasting
	nutrient status on Hoosfield in 1986 and 1987. The grain and straw
	total N and 15N content was measured over several years (Glendining et
	al, 1997, 2001).</p>

<h3>
	<strong>Methodology</strong>
</h3>

<p>For analytical techniques used prior to 1968 see Johnston (1969)
	in Methodology References below.</p>
<h4>
	<strong>Nitrogen (N)</strong>
</h4>

<p>
	<b>1968-1995:</b> nitrogen content was determined by Kjeldahl digest,
	the digest was then analysed colorimetrically using a Technicon
	segmented flow analyser. If nitrate-N was expected to be high in the
	sample, the salicylic acid modification was used (Bremner, 1965).
</p>

<p>
	<b>1996 onwards:</b> nitrogen content is determined by combustion
	analyser, based on the Dumas method. Originally a Heraeus Combustion
	analyser, currently a LECO combustion system is used.
</p>

<h4>
	<strong>Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium
		(Mg), Sodium (Na) and Sulphur (S)</strong>
</h4>

<p>
	<b>1968-late 1980s:</b> dry ashing techniques, as described by Piper
	(1942) were used to produce an acid extract. The extracts were analysed
	for P colorimetrically on a Technicon Auto Analyser, or later
	equivalents (Alpkem continuous flow system / Skalar SanPlus segmented
	flow system), using the modified Murphy &amp; Riley (1962) molybdenum blue
	method developed from Fogg &amp; Wilkinson (1958). K, Ca, Mg and Na were
	determined using automated atomic absorption methods. The SP90 atomic
	absorption flame photometer was used to analyse Ca, Mg and Na; K was
	analysed by the EEL flame photometer until 1973, K was then analysed
	with Ca, Mg and Na by the SP90. S was not routinely measured until
	1996.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1980s onwards:</b> since the late 1980s the open tube
	nitric-perchloric digestion (Zarcinas, et al, 1987) has been used to
	produce an acid extract. P, K, Ca, Mg and Na have been determined by
	ICP-OES (Inductively-coupled plasma - optical emission Spectrometer)
	since 1982, and S since 1996.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Blank (control) values:</b> Data for sodium is presented after the
	analysis blanks (controls) have been subtracted from the raw data.
	Sodium blank values tend to be relatively large, and can be greater
	than the raw data. If subtracting the blank resulted in a negative
	value, this is shown as zero. Thus the sodium data should be treated
	with some caution. Blank (control) readings for the other nutrients are
	very small, relative to the sample values, and have not been
	subtracted.
