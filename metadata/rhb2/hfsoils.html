
<H2>Hoosfield Continuous Spring Barley Experiment soil chemical and
	physical properties</H2>
<p>The Continuous Spring Barley experiment was started in 1852 on a
	1.7 hectare (4.25 acre) site on Hoosfield, to test the effects of
	organic manure and inorganic fertilizer on the growth of spring barley.
	The site has probably been occupied since Roman times, and the
	Rothamsted map of 1623 shows the site under arable cultivation. Arable
	crops grown 1847-1851, before the experiment started were: turnips
	(with FYM and superphosphate) 1847; barley 1848; clover 1849; wheat
	1850; barley (with ammonium salts) 1851.</p>

</p>
<p>
	<b>Soil texture class: </b> Flinty silty clay loam topsoil over
	clay-with–flints (Avery and Catt, 1995). The soils contain a large
	number of flints and are slightly calcareous. Below about 2m depth the
	soil becomes chalk. The experiment is under-drained and the site is
	free draining.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil texture,</b> 0-23cm (from Blake <i>et al</i>, 2003, plots 42
	and 72)
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sand: 28 %</li>
	<li>Silt: 52 %</li>
	<li>Clay (<2 &micro;m): 20 %</li>
</UL>
<p>From Avery and Catt (1995): Typical Batcombe series topsoil
	contains 18-27% clay, with clay content increasing with depth.</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil pH:</b> Since the 1950s, chalk has been applied when and where
	necessary to maintain a soil pH of 7.0 – 7.5. Liming stopped in
	1968-1974 but started again in 1975. Since 2007 lime has been applied
	to most plots except the control strips and the no P strip every 5 or 6
	years. Like several other old arable fields at Rothamsted, Hoosfield
	was given large dressings of chalk in the early part of the 19th
	century, when the practice was to dig out the underlying chalk and
	spread it on the arable land. Detailed surveys of soil pH and CaCO<sub>3</sub>
	around 1954 suggested that these early large dressings were not applied
	uniformly, and the amount applied lessened with increasing distance
	from one side or corner of the field. This meant that parts of the
	field became acidic earlier than others. (Warren and Johnston, 1967;
	Jenkinson and Johnston, 1977).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Soil movement:</b> Warren and Johnston (1967) and also Poulton
	(1996) discuss the early movement of soil across plot boundaries due to
	cultivation both along and across the plots. As a result of soil
	transects carried out in the 1950s, cultivations were restricted, and
	wide discard areas between plots introduced in the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Plot sizes:</b> Plots lengths: All 12.19m, except plots in strips 6
	and 7, which are 9.14m. Plot widths: All 10.52m. Currently harvested
	area is plot length x 2.1m width. Plot harvested area data is included
	with plot yield data.

<h3>Soil chemical properties</h3>
<p>
	Soil chemical properties have been measured at regular intervals on
	Hoosfield since 1852, in topsoils (0-23cm) and subsoils. See <a
		href="metadata/rhb2/Measurements of Hoosfield soil properties 1852.pdf"
		target="_blank">soil measurements 1852-2013 </A> for details of what
	data is available. Not all plots or soil depths have been measured
	every year. The following soil properties have been measured:
</p>
<UL>
	<li>%N : total soil Nitrogen %</li>
	<li>%SOC : soil organic Carbon %</li>
	<li>Olsen P : plant-available phoshorus, by extraction with a
		solution of 0.5<i>M</i> NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, buffered at pH 8.5
	</li>
	<li>pH : soil pH in water (1:2.5 soil : solution)</li>
	<li>Extractable cations : extractable Ca, K, Mg and Na</li>
	<li>% CaCO<sub>3</sub> : by manometry
	</li>
	<li>soil weights : see below for more details</li>

	<b>Soil inorganic N measurements:</b> See Bakar et al (1994) below for
	estimates of nitrate leaching using Br and N-15 tracers; see also
	Powlson et al (1989) below for measurements of nitrate leaching from
	FYM and inorganic N fertilizer plots.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Denitrification measurements:</b> See Webster and Goulding (1989)
	below for measurements of denitrification in autumn 1987 from
	Hoosfield, comparing high and low SOC plots. See also Bakar et al,
	(1994) below for estimates of denitrication using Br and N-15 tracers.
</p>
<p>
	<b>15N-labelled fertilizer measurements:</b> See Glendining et al
	(1997; 2001) for details of the fate of 15N-labelled fertilizer applied
	to the Hoosfield Spring Barley experiment in 1986 and 1987.

<h2>Soil organic carbon (SOC)</h2>
<P>
	Soil organic carbon has been measured at regular intervals on Hoosfield
	since 1852, in topsoils (0-23cm) and subsoils. See <a
		href="metadata/rhb2/Measurements of Hoosfield soil properties 1852.pdf"
		target="_blank">soil measurements 1852-2013 </A> for details of what
	data is available. Not all plots or soil depths have been measured
	every year. See long-term SOC for selected treatments under 'Datasets'. 
</p>



	<p>
		<b>Herbst et al (2018)</b> (see Key References, below) measured soil
		carbon fractions from selected fresh and archived soil samples from
		1882-2012. They measured TOC (total organic carbon), and different POM
		(particulate organic matter) fractions, from plot 11 (no fertilizer or
		manure since 1852), plot 7.1 (FYM 1852-1871), plot 7.2 (FYM since
		1852) and plot 7.3 (FYM since 2001), along with fresh soils from the <a

	<H3>Soil weight Mkg/ha, Main Plots</H3>
	<P>
		The following standard soil weights should be used for Hoosfield
		Continuous Spring Barley Main Plots. All weights are in 10<sup>6
		</sup>kg/ha of oven-dry fine soil. To convert to g/cm3 divide by depth in cm
		(eg 23) and multiply by 10. Data prepared by A J Macdonald and P R
		Poulton, 2012, derived from Jenkinson and Johnston (1977). Note that
		plot 11 (unfertilized) on the north-east part of the experimental site
		has a greater soil weight than the other unfertilized plots (61 and
		62) and those receiving inorganic fertilizer (eg plot 42). The
		unfertilized plot used in the Hoosfield <a
			href="Hoos/hoos_open_access#SEC1"> SOC Open Access </a> figure is
		plot 11.
