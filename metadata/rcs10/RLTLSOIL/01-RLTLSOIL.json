            "description": "The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on a sequence of arable crops, on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. Mg, Mn and S were tested on split plots at different times. Target soil pH was 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. This dataset contains soil pH, Olsen P and exchangeable cations (Ca, K, Mg and Na). There is a parallel experiment at Woburn Experimental Farm. Since 1997 the experiment has been in grass."

Manganese was tested on split plots 1987-1990; Sulphur was tested on split plots 1991-1996. 2 replicates.\r\n\r\n- **Soil pH** measured in water: 1:2.5 soil: water suspension using a standard electrode and pH meter.\r\n- **Olsen P** soil extracted with a solution of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, buffered at pH8.5, after the method of Olsen et al, 1954.\r\n- **Exchangeable cations** measured in sieved (<2mm) air-dry soil leached with 1 M ammonium acetate, adjusted to pH 7. Leachates analysed by emission or atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry.  Since 1989, the extracts have been analysed by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer)."

For topsoil 12-20 cores were taken from the central area of each plot and combined to make one sample. For subsoil, generally 5-6 cores were taken and combined. Baseline soil pH measurements were taken in February 1962, before the first lime application. Soil samples were generally taken in the autumn, after the current crop was harvested and before the soil was ploughed for the next harvest year, so that the soil properties could be related to the treatments applied in the previous harvest year."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate.\r\nThe Analytical Chemistry Unit follows the Joint Code of Practice (JCoPR) and participates in European Quality Assurance programmes. All performance is strictly monitored using certified external standards alongside in-house standard materials. Standards and check samples are monitored and recorded."
