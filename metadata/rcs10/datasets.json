        "description": "The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on the yields of a sequence of arable crops, on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. Mg, Mn and S were tested on split plots at different times. Target soil pH was 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. There is a parallel experiment at Woburn Experimental Farm. Since 1997 the experiment has been in grass. The dataset contains plot and sub-plot yields for all plots and years, 1962-1996, details of all treatments applied (lime, P, K, Mg, Mn and S), and agronomic details (crop variety, sowing and harvest date, basal fertilizer).",

The site is a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. There was a parallel experiment on a sandy loam soil at Woburn Experimental Farm. The dataset contains grain mineral compostion for 20 different minerals (mg/kg dry soil), for individual plots, measured in 1978, 1981  and 1995. It includes details  of the lime and fertilizer treatments, and crop yield.",
