The soil contains a large number of flints and some rounded pebbles from the material derived from the Reading Beds. The soil is naturally acid and free draining. Below about 2m depth the soil becomes chalk.\n\nSoil pH: Since the 1950s, chalk (CaCO3) has been applied as necessary to maintain a minimum soil pH of 7.0. Like several other old arable fields at Rothamsted, Hoosfield was given large dressings of chalk in the early 19th century, when the practice was to dig out the underlying chalk and spread it on the arable land. Chalk was applied at up to 250 t/ha, and this increased topsoil pH in water (23cm) to between 7.0 and 8.0 (from Poulton et al, 2013)."
