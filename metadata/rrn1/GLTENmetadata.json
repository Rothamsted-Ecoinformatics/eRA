This was because soil and plant analyses had shown plots growing hay, cut grass and lucerne lost more K than grazed plots, which would affect the yield of test crops.\nPlots were further split to measure potash and phosphate responses in test-crop potatoes that followed different leys.\nFrom 1958, the standard applications of P and K were revised and corrective dressing applied.",
