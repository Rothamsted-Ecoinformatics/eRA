DESCRIPTION
    The site was originally permanent grassland since 1838 (>100 years). Some plots stayed in permanent grass, others went into continuous arable cropping and some alternated between leys and arable. 

Yields are no longer measured but SOM continues to be measured. Available P and K in soil have been measured periodically. 

The main comparisons have been of four rotations, each of six years duration. The arable with lay rotation includes a one-year ley cut for hay. The other three have had three-year leys of different species and different management, followed by three arable crops and are referred to as 'test crops'.

Highfield Ley Arable runs in contrast to Fosters Ley Arable which has the same soil type but a different cropping history (having been in continuous cropping for several centuries).
    To study the effects of various three-year leys on the fertility of the soil as measured by a sequence of three arable test crops.
