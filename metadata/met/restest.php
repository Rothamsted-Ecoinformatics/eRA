Rothamsted has one of the longest continuous sets of weather recordings
in the world. The observations are taken daily at 0900GMT. The records
are still kept in the hand-written form as they have from the beginning
but modern technology is also used. Both the Rothamsted mainframe and
personal computers are used to store and distribute the data. This data
is primarily for the use of Rothamsted staff in connection with their
field experiments and the Meteorological Office at Bracknell who
maintain a comprehensive database of weather recordings from the whole
country.   </p>
<P>
Records of day to day weather were originally in the form of diaries
kept by the large farms and estates, may of which still exist. Although
these do not contain any actual data they are a valuable source of
information regarding our weather of years gone by. Rothamsted's daily
meteorological instrument records as we know them, began in February
1853. </p>

<P>
At an early stage in Sir John Lawes agricultural research work, he
realised how important the weather was in the growth of crops,
particularly rainfall, and the effect this had on the leaching of
nutrients from the soil. </p>
<P>
He tried many ways of measuring rainfall before finally settling for a
gauge of one thousandth of an acre. The original gauge was built in
1852, constructed mainly of timber with a lead funnel, and positioned
slightly north of the present one. The rainwater was collected in
carboys and weighed daily to find the amount of rain. This gauge became
weak and in 1873 a new one was constructed on the present site. At the
same time the technique of weighing was replaced by galvanized iron
calibrated cylinders which made the job of rain measurement much
easier.  The gauge itself has seen little change in its long history
other than routine repairs and new collecting tanks as the older ones
rusted away. The current tanks are about four years old and are made of
modern plastics following on from glass, iron and steel ones previously
used. The funnel was completely restored in 1992 to its original
hardwood and lead construction.</p>
<P>
At various times other smaller raingauges were used, both 5 and 8 inch
funnel diameter. In 1948, the present 5 inch diameter gauge was
installed which is now the Meteorological Office standard. In our case
the gauge is surrounded by a turf wall retained by brick; this reduced
wind eddies in our exposed position. </p>
