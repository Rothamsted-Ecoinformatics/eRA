				Welcome to the <b>Rothamsted Weather Data for the Schools</b> web
				page. We hope that the data here will be used by anyone with an
				interest in local weather, including teachers and students, in the
				classroom or for projects at home. There is information on long-term
				weather and question sheets for schools, and also lots of background
				information on how the data is measured on the Weather Data for the
				Public page.

	<p>The provision of the schools data arose after discussions with
		local secondary schools who expressed an interest in using &quot;real
		local data&quot;. It is anticipated the data will be useful in a
		variety of National Curriculum subjects including geography, science,
		maths and computing.</p>

	<h3>Long-term weather</h3>
	<p>The long-term weather records at Rothamsted have been invaluable
		in aiding understanding of the effects of climate on crop growth,
		yields and diseases. They have revealed changes in temperature and
		rainfall over 170 years. The annual mean air temperature has
		fluctuated considerably and rose sharply between 1987-2007.</p>
	<p>The figure shows the annual mean air temperature at Rothamsted
		every year from 1878 - 2013. Also shown is the mean over each five
		year period, 1878-1882, 1883-1887, etc. The red line shows the mean
		temperature, 1878-1987. The mean air temperature at Rothamsted is now
		10 &ordm;C, 1&ordm;C higher than the 1878-1987 average. The 10 warmest
		years on record occured in the last 17 years. Mean soil temperatures
		have also risen.</p>
