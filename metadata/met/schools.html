	<b>Schools weather data:</b> The provision of the schools data arose
	after discussions with local secondary schools who expressed an
	interest in using &quot;real local data&quot;. It is anticipated the
	data will be useful in a variety of National Curriculum subjects
	including geography, science, maths and computing. All the data are

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	<b>History of weather measurements at Rothamsted:</b>
</p>
<p>Sir John Lawes, the founder of Rothamsted, realized that to
	understand crop growth, it was important to have records of the
	weather. Weather records also help us to understand the spread of crop
	diseases and insect behaviour. Rainfall and wind direction have been
	measured at Rothamsted every day since 1853, temperature since 1878 and
	sunshine since 1890, making this one of the longest sets of
	meteorological (weather) data available in the UK. As new equipment was
	invented to measure different meteorological variables, scientists
	added them to the Rothamsted weather station. Now over 25 different
	weather measurements are made every day.</p>
<p>
	<b>How the data is measured:</b>
</p>
<p>Originally all the weather data were recorded by hand. Every
	morning at 9am a scientist would go out to the weather station, seven
	days a week, 365(6) days a year. Then in 2004 the Rothamsted weather
	station was fully automated, and the weather data is now measured by a
	range of sensors attached to an automatic data logger, linked directly
	to a computer.</p>

	<b>Location of the weather station:</b>
</p>
<p>The weather data stored in our electronic database (e-RA) is
	recorded by the Rothamsted weather station in Harpenden, Herts. Its
	specific location is Latitude 51.82 North &amp; Longitude 0.37 West. It
	is 128 metres above sea level. GB Grid Reference: TL121134. The site is
	fairly open and surrounded by sports fields and arable fields.</p>

<p>
	<strong><b>The e-RA database:</b></strong>
</p>
<p>e-RA is an on-line database developed by Rothamsted scientists to
	provide safe and secure storage of the data from Rothamsted's long-term
	experiments and meteorological (weather) data. The data are freely
	available for use by scientists and universities. A subset of weather
	data have been made specifically available for schools.</p>

	title="Rothamsted rain gauge" width="110" height="146" align="left"
	hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
	<b>Rainfall (RAIN):</b> This is total rainfall over 24 hours, measured
	in mm. It includes rain, snow, mist and fog (together called
	precipitation). Originally the rain was collected in a copper funnel
	rain gauge, and the water measured manually in a graduated cylinder.
	Since 2004, rain is measured using an electronic tipping bucket rain
	gauge, calibrated to tip at 0.2mm. This means that since 2004, the
	minimum amount of rain that can be recorded is 0.2mm. These rain gauges
	are surrounded by a 1.5m radius turf wall, 30cm deep, to reduce wind
	eddies blowing the rain out of the gauges.

<td></td>
<p>
	<b>Sunshine (SUNHOURS):</b> The total amount of time when the sun
	shines during each day. This is measured in hours, for example, 10.5
	hours means 10 hours and 30 minutes. Hours of sunshine were originally
	measured by a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. The sun's rays were
	focused onto a card (treated to prevent it from catching fire) and the
	brown scorch mark on the card was then measured. The longer the scorch
	mark, the longer the hours of sun. The cards were of varying lengths
	applicable to the time of year (winter, equinox, and summer). Since
	2004 sunshine has been calculated using the Campbell-Stokes equation
	from solar radiation measured using a thermopile pyranometer.

	title="Rothamsted thermometers" width="110" height="163" hspace="5"
	vspace="5" align="left" alt="" />
<p>
	<b>Temperature (TMAX and TMIN):</b> The maximum and minimum air
	temperatures during the day, measured in &deg;C. TMIN should be less
	than or equal to TMAX. The daily temperature is the mean of TMAX and
	TMIN ((TMAX + TMIN)/2). Temperature used to be measured with a maximum
	and minimum mercury thermometer. Since 2004, electronic temperature
	probes have been used, which are linked to the automatic data logger.
	The thermometers are housed in a unit called a Stephenson Screen to
	ensure shade from sun - ventilation is provided by slits in the sides.

<p>
	<b>Wind (WDIR):</b> Wind direction, measured at 09.00 GMT each morning.
	This is shown as an angle, going clockwise from the North. 360 = North,
	90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West. The reading is in degrees. 0
	degrees means that there is no wind. Wind direction was originally
	measured by a wind vane linked to a Munro roll chart recorder. From
	2004 an electronic wind vane linked to the automatic data logger has
	been used. See video of wind direction recorder (above) to show this in
	action.<b> Wind run (WINDRUN):</b> The total amount of wind in a day,
	measured as a distance (km). Wind run is measured by a cup anemometer,
	which is blown around by the wind, and the distance it turns around is
	recorded, in km. This is on a pole 2m high. Since 2004, an electronic
	cup anemometer has been used, which is linked to the automatic data
	logger. See video of wind speed recorder (above) to show this in
	action.

<h2>Long-term weather</h2>
<p>The long-term weather records at Rothamsted have been invaluable
	in aiding understanding of the effects of climate on crop growth,
	yields and diseases. They have revealed changes in temperature and
	rainfall over 170 years. The annual mean air temperature has fluctuated
	considerably and rose sharply between 1987-2007.</p>
<p>The figure shows the annual mean air temperature at Rothamsted
	every year from 1878 - 2013. Also shown is the mean over each five year
	period, 1878-1882, 1883-1887, etc. The red line shows the mean
	temperature, 1878-1987. The mean air temperature at Rothamsted is now
	10 ºC, 1 ºC higher than the 1878-1987 average. The 10 warmest years on
	record occured in the last 17 years. Mean soil temperatures have also
	risen.</p>
