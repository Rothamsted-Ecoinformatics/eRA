<h2>Rainfall</h2>

<p><B>Rothamsted:</B> Rainfall has been measured at Rothamsted since 1853. The variable <B> RAIN_L</B> has been measured using a rain gauge of 
1/1000th of an acre (4.047 sq metres), built in 1852. The gauge was constructed of timber with a lead funnel. Rain was collected daily
 in carboys and weighed to estimate the amount of rain. In 1873 a new gauge was installed and the carboys replaced by galvanized iron
 calibrated cylinders to measure rainfall. The old gauge was replaced by an identical new one in 1992. From 2004 onwards the calibrated
 cylinders were replaced by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge (Campbell Scientific, ARG100) calibrated to tip with every 0.0025mm of
 rain. </p>

<p>The variable <B>RAIN </B> was originally recorded in a 5 inch (12.7cm) rain gauge built in a garden near the laboratory in 1852. The water
 collected was measured in a graduated cylinder until about 1880. The gauge was then moved to the meteorological enclosure. In 1948, a
 5 inch (12.7cm) copper rain gauge of Meteorological Office standard was installed within a 0.3 m high, 1.5 m radius turf wall retained
 by brick to reduce wind eddies. Since 2004, <B>RAIN </B> has been measured by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge of 25.4cm diameter,
calibrated to tip at 0.2mm, also within the turf wall. The 5 inch copper rain gauge is still used to check the calibration of 
the adjacent electronic tipping bucket rain gauge. It is also used to measure precipitation fallen as snow when the tipping bucket rain gauge
 is blocked with snow or ice.  
 </p>

<p> Rain duration <B>RDUR</B> has been measured at Rothamsted since 1931. It is defined as the number of hours during which rain fell over
 the previous 24 hours, recorded at 0900 GMT each day. Originally it was measured by a Negretti and Zamra natural siphon rain recorder.
 Rain was collected in a float chamber and recorded on a daily chart on a clock drum, which recorded 10mm of rain before siphoning 
began and the recording restarted at the bottom of the chart. In 1978 this was replaced with a Cassella recorder with a diameter
 of 20.3cm.  Since 2004 it has been measured by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge. </p>

</p>
<p><B> Woburn: </B> Since 1999, Rainfall (<B>RAIN</B>) has been measured by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge (Campbell Scientific, ARG100).  </p>

<h2>Percolation (drainage)</h2>
<p><B>Measured at Rothamsted only: </B>

Three drain gauges (20, 40 and 60 inches) were constructed at Rothamsted in 1870. They consist of undisturbed blocks of
 soil 20, 40 and 60 inches (51,102 and 152 cm, respectively) deep and are equal in area to the rain gauge of 1/1000th of an acre.</p>

<p>The gauges were constructed by digging under and around the block of soil, placing perforated plates underneath at the required
 depth and bricking up the sides. The soil around the gauges remained undisturbed throughout the construction process. Drain water 
was originally measured by weighing the carboys of collected water (as for 1/1000th of an acre rainfall above), but these too were
 replaced by calibrated cylinders. In 2004 those were replaced by the electronic tipping bucket rain gauge. Percolation is the total
 over the previous 24 hours, recorded at 0900GMT. All three drain gauges remain as originally built. The soil has never been deep
 cultivated or cropped and the top is kept clear by hand weeding. </p>

<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p>Temperature is measured over the 24 hour period up to 0900GMT; this is used for the previous day's maximum 
temperature<B> (TMAX)</B>. Until 1970 all temperatures were measured in ºF; since 1972 they have been recorded in ºC. All 
temperatures in e-RA are displayed as ºC. </p>

<p><B>Rothamsted:</b></p>
<p><b> Air temperatures </b></B> Maximum <B>(TMAX)</B> and minimum <b> (TMIN) </b> air temperatures were first recorded in 1878. <B>TMAX</B> was recorded using a mercury column
 thermometer and <b>TMIN </b>using a spirit-in-glass with indicator bar minimum thermometer. In 1915 dry <B>(DRYB)</B> and wet <B>(WETB)</B> bulb mercury column thermometers were introduced to record air temperatures
 and calculate variables such as relative humidity, vapour pressure and dew point. <b>GRSMIN</b>, the minimum temperature on grass, was first 
recorded in 1909 using a spirit-in-glass with indicator bar minimum thermometer. </p>  
<p><B>Soil temperatures</B> were first recorded in the 1930's using specially adapted thermometers. These were set at depths of 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 inches (10, 20, 30, 61, and
 122 cm) under grass cover <B>(G10T, G20T, G30T, E30T, E50T and E100T) </B>and 4, 8 and 12 inches (10, 20 and 30 cm) under bare soil
<B> (S10T, S20T and S30T)</B>.  <B>G10T, G20T, G30T, S10T and S20T </B>were in direct contact with the soil; G30T was discontinued in 1997. 
The thermometers used to measure <B> E30T, E50T, E100T and S30T</B> were encased in a glass sheath in a metal tube, so that they could
 easily be removed to read the temperature. The bulb was set in paraffin wax to minimize rapid temperature fluctuations when the
 thermometer was removed from the soil.</P>
<P>  
Since 2004, all temperatures (air and soil) have been recorded by thermistors (electronic temperature probes, Campbell Scientific, type 107). For measuring soil 
temperatures, these are buried in the soil at the appropriate depth.</p>

<p><B> Woburn:</b></p>
<p><b> Air temperatures </b></B>Maximum <B> (TMAX)</B> and minimum <B> (TMIN)</B> temperatures were first recorded in 1928 using mercury column
 thermometers. Dry <B>(DRYB)</B> and wet<B> (WETB)</B> bulb mercury column thermometers were used to record air temperatures and 
calculate variables such as relative humidity, vapour pressure and dew point.</P>  
<P><B>Soil temperatures</B> were first recorded in 1928 using
 specially adapted thermometers. These were set at depths of 12 and 40 inches (30 and 102 cm) under grass cover<B> (E30T, E100T)</B>.
 From 1968, soil temperatures were also measured at 20, 24 and 48 inches (51, 61 and 122 cm, <B>E50T, E60T and E122T</B>) under grass 
cover. Soil temperatures under bare soil were measured at 4 and 8 inches (10 and 20 cm, <B>S10T and S20T</B>). On 1st December 2009 
<B>WETB </B>was discontinued and replaced by a Relative Humidity Sensor (Rotronics, MP100A) to measure relative humidity <B>(RELH) </B>
and from which vapour pressure and dew point are now calculated. </p>

<h2>Sunshine hours</h2>

<P><B>Rothamsted:</B> Sunshine readings (hours of bright sunshine,<B> SUN)</B> were first recorded in 1892 using a Campbell-Stokes sunshine 
recorder. The sun's rays are focused onto a card (treated to prevent it from catching fire) and the brown scorch mark on the card is 
then measured. The cards are of varying lengths applicable to the time of year (winter, equinox, and summer). Since 2004 sunshine has
been calculated using the Campbell-Stokes equation from solar radiation measured using a Kipp and Zonen thermopile pyranometer. </p>

<P>The maximum temperature in the sun, <B>SUNMAX</B>, was recorded between 1915 and 1935 using a black bulb in vacuo. </p>

<p><B>Woburn:</B> Since 1999 sunshine (hours of bright sunshine,<B> SUN)</B> has been calculated using the Campbell-Stokes equation
from solar radiation measurements using a Kipp and Zonen thermopile pyranometer. Previously it was measured with a sunshine recorder. </p>


<A NAME="SEC5"></a>
<h2>Solar Radiation</h2>

<p><B>Rothamsted: </B> Total global solar radiation <B>(RAD)</B> over a 24 hour period up to 0900GMT was first recorded at Rothamsted 
in 1931. Initially measurements were made by the Plant Physiology Department of Imperial College using their own calendar recorder. 
Rothamsted took over the instrument in 1948.  In 1955, a Moll-type solarimeter (Kipp) was installed. The daily totals were obtained
by planimeter integration until 1958 when an automatic integrator was added. A Kipp and Zonen integrator was installed in 1989. 
In 2004 this was replaced by a Kipp and Zonen thermopile pyranometer. </p>

<p><B>Woburn: </B>At Woburn solar radiation <B>(RAD)</B> is measured using a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen, CM6B). </p>

<h2>Wind</h2>


<p><B>Rothamsted:</B> Wind direction<B> (WDIR) </B>has been measured since 1853. Wind speed was originally estimated using the 
Beaufort scale. It is shown in e-RA as wind force<B> (WFORCE) </B>from 1915 to 1959. From 1960 onwards it is shown as wind speed 
<B>(WINDSP)</B>converted from knots to m/s. </p>

<p>The Beaufort scale can be adjusted to wind speed using the following equation:</p>

<p>V = 1.624 x SQR B3 </p>

<p>Where V = wind speed in knots, B = Beaufort scale (1 knot = 0.514 m/s) (Met Office 1982).  </p>

<p>Wind direction <B> (WDIR) </B> and wind speed <B>(WINDSP) </B> were measured by a Munro roll chart recorder (model IM175) 
installed in 1978 linked to a wind vane and a cup anemometer, respectively, at 12.8m above ground level.</p>

<p>Measurements of wind run <B>(WINDRUN)</B> are available from 1946 onwards, first measured using a cup anemometer with a calibrated
meter installed at a height of 2m. Since 2004 wind variables have been measured using an electronic wind vane (Vector Instruments, W200P) and
a cup anemometer (Vector Instruments, A100K) at 12.8m. Wind run is adjusted to the standard height of 2m by multiplying by 0.78:</p>

<p>Vh/V10 = 0.233+0.656*log10 (h+4.75), where Vh = speed in knots at height h, V10 = speed at 10m and h = height in m
(Met Office 1982).</p>


<p><B>Woburn:</B> Wind speed was originally estimated using the Beaufort scale. It is shown in e-RA as wind force <B>(WFORCE)</B> from
1928 to 1967. From 1968 onwards it is shown as wind speed <B>(WINDSP)</B> converted from knots to m/s. </p>

<p>The Beaufort scale can be adjusted to wind speed using the following equation:</p>

<p>V = 1.624 x SQR B3 </p>

<p>Where V = wind speed in knots, B = Beaufort scale (1 knot = 0.514 m/s). (Met Office 1982).</p>

<p>From 01/07/1999 onwards wind speed has been measured using an automated cup anemometer at 2m height. This sensor was replaced
in July 2008 with a new cup anemometer (Vector Instruments, A100LK). The values in e-RA have been adjusted to the standard height
of 10m.</p>

<p>Wind run <B>(WINDRUN)</B> was first measured using a cup anemometer installed at 2m with a calibrated meter. Since July 1999
it has been measured by a cup anemometer at 2m, the same instrument used for measuring wind speed (see above). </p>

<p>Wind Direction<B> (WDIR)</B> was estimated from a wind vane with fixed ordinal points. In 1999 this method was replaced by an electronic
wind vane ( Vector Instruments, W200P).</p>

<h2>Evaporation</h2>

<p><B>Rothamsted:</B> In 1924, a brick-lined pit 8ft (2.44m) and 20ft (6.1m), surrounded by 12 cylinders set in the soil was built 
at the Rothamsted meteorological enclosure. The cylinders were 6ft (1.83m) deep and 2ft 6in. (0.76m) in diameter and made
of cast iron lined with a 1/2in. layer of bitumen painted concrete; the bottom of the cylinders sloped down to an outlet pipe accessible
from the pit. Five of the cylinders were filled with a sandy loam from Woburn, the soil texture being uniform throughout.  
Three of the soil cylinders had turf laid on top of the soil; the other soil surfaces were kept bare. The soil was left to settle
and weather for 16 years.  Ten cylinders were joined up in pairs at the outlets, each soil cylinder being connected to an unfilled
cylinder, so forming a set of U tubes. Waterproof covers were provided for the unfilled cylinders (minors) to prevent entry of rain
and to reduce evaporation losses to negligible amounts. The minors were filled with water until the soil or turf surfaces were 
flooded, then water was run out until the water-table had reached a pre-determined depth below the surface. One of the minors was 
filled to near the brim and the level kept at 1 in. below the surface and this was selected as the open water standard. For further
details refer to Penman (1948).</p>  

<p> A standard meteorological Office evaporation tank was installed in 1945. The galvanized iron tank measured 2ft 6in (0.76m)
in diameter and was 2ft (0.61m) deep. The water level was kept at or near ground level, leaving a projecting rim of 3in (7.62 cm). 
The level was read daily with a hook gauge reading to 1/100 in., and topped or drained as necessary. </p>

<p>Evaporation measurements ceased in 1974 and values were instead derived from wet and dry bulb temperatures. </p>


<A NAME="SEC8"></a>
<h2>Other variables</h2>

<p>Other variables such as barometric pressure, etc were recorded onto Meteorological Office 
return sheets as extra columns. Visual measurements of  cloud cover, state of the ground's surface, visibility, current weather,
etc were collected daily and entered into a diary. Visual measurements ceased to be made at Woburn in 1999 and at Rothamsted in 
May 2007. Evaporation, vapour pressure, dew point, relative humidity and potential soil moisture deficit are derived from wet and
dry bulb temperatures. Since 2009, at Woburn, the wet bulb sensor has been replaced by a relative humidity sensor
(Campbell Scientific, MP100A). </p>
