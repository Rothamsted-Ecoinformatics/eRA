	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>
		<b>History of weather measurements at Rothamsted:</b>
	</p>
	<p>Sir John Lawes, the founder of Rothamsted, realized that to
		understand crop growth, it was important to have records of the
		weather. Weather records also help us to understand the spread of crop
		diseases and insect behaviour. Rainfall and wind direction have been
		measured at Rothamsted every day since 1853, temperature since 1878
		and sunshine since 1890, making this one of the longest sets of
		meteorological (weather) data available in the UK. As new equipment
		was invented to measure different meteorological variables, scientists
		added them to the Rothamsted weather station. Now over 25 different
		weather measurements are made every day.</p>
	<p>
		<b>How the data is measured:</b>
	</p>
	<p>Originally all the weather data were recorded by hand. Every
		morning at 9am a scientist would go out to the weather station, seven
		days a week, 365(6) days a year. Then in 2004 the Rothamsted weather
		station was fully automated, and the weather data is now measured by a
		range of sensors attached to an automatic data logger, linked directly
		to a computer.</p>

		<b>Location of the weather station:</b>
	</p>
	<p>The weather data stored in our electronic database (e-RA) is
		recorded by the Rothamsted weather station in Harpenden, Herts. Its
		specific location is Latitude 51.82 North &amp; Longitude 0.37 West.
		It is 128 metres above sea level. GB Grid Reference: TL121134. The
		site is fairly open and surrounded by sports fields and arable fields.</p>

	<p>
		<strong><b>The e-RA database:</b></strong>
	</p>
	<p>e-RA is an on-line database developed by Rothamsted scientists
		to provide safe and secure storage of the data from Rothamsted's
		long-term experiments and meteorological (weather) data. The data are
		freely available for use by scientists and universities. A subset of
		weather data have been made specifically available for schools.</p>

				<b>Rainfall (RAIN):</b> This is total rainfall over 24 hours,
				measured in mm. It includes rain, snow, mist and fog (together
				called precipitation). Originally the rain was collected in a copper
				funnel rain gauge, and the water measured manually in a graduated
				cylinder. Since 2004, rain is measured using an electronic tipping
				bucket rain gauge, calibrated to tip at 0.2mm. This means that since
				2004, the minimum amount of rain that can be recorded is 0.2mm.
				These rain gauges are surrounded by a 1.5m radius turf wall, 30cm
				deep, to reduce wind eddies blowing the rain out of the gauges.

			<b>Sunshine (SUNHOURS):</b> The total amount of time when the sun
			shines during each day. This is measured in hours, for example, 10.5
			hours means 10 hours and 30 minutes. Hours of sunshine were
			originally measured by a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. The sun's
			rays were focused onto a card (treated to prevent it from catching
			fire) and the brown scorch mark on the card was then measured. The
			longer the scorch mark, the longer the hours of sun. The cards were
			of varying lengths applicable to the time of year (winter, equinox,
			and summer). Since 2004 sunshine has been calculated using the
			Campbell-Stokes equation from solar radiation measured using a
			thermopile pyranometer.

				<b>Temperature (TMAX and TMIN):</b> The maximum and minimum air

				than or equal to TMAX. The daily temperature is the mean of TMAX and
				TMIN ((TMAX + TMIN)/2). Temperature used to be measured with a
				maximum and minimum mercury thermometer. Since 2004, electronic
				temperature probes have been used, which are linked to the automatic
				data logger. The thermometers are housed in a unit called a
				Stephenson Screen to ensure shade from sun - ventilation is provided
				by slits in the sides.

				<b>Wind (WDIR):</b> Wind direction, measured at 09.00 GMT each

				360 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West. The reading is in
				degrees. 0 degrees means that there is no wind. Wind direction was
				originally measured by a wind vane linked to a Munro roll chart
				recorder. From 2004 an electronic wind vane linked to the automatic
				data logger has been used. See video of wind direction recorder
				(above) to show this in action.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Wind run (WINDRUN):</b> The total amount of wind in a day,
				measured as a distance (km). Wind run is measured by a cup
				anemometer, which is blown around by the wind, and the distance it
				turns around is recorded, in km. This is on a pole 2m high. Since
				2004, an electronic cup anemometer has been used, which is linked to

	<h2>Long-term weather</h2>
	<p>The long-term weather records at Rothamsted have been invaluable
		in aiding understanding of the effects of climate on crop growth,
		yields and diseases. They have revealed changes in temperature and
		rainfall over 170 years. The annual mean air temperature has
		fluctuated considerably and rose sharply between 1987-2007.</p>
	<p>The figure shows the annual mean air temperature at Rothamsted
		every year from 1878 - 2013. Also shown is the mean over each five
		year period, 1878-1882, 1883-1887, etc. The red line shows the mean
		temperature, 1878-1987. The mean air temperature at Rothamsted is now
		10 ºC, 1 ºC higher than the 1878-1987 average. The 10 warmest years on
		record occured in the last 17 years. Mean soil temperatures have also
		risen.</p>
