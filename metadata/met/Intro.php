Rothamsted has one of the longest continuous sets of weather recordings
in the world. The observations are taken daily at 0900GMT. The records
are still kept in the hand-written form as they have from the beginning
but modern technology is also used. Both the Rothamsted mainframe and
personal computers are used to store and distribute the data. This data
is primarily for the use of Rothamsted staff in connection with their
field experiments and the Meteorological Office at Bracknell who
maintain a comprehensive database of weather recordings from the whole
country.
</p>
<P>
Records of day to day weather were originally in the form of diaries
kept by the large farms and estates, may of which still exist. Although
these do not contain any actual data they are a valuable source of
information regarding our weather of years gone by. Rothamsted's daily
meteorological instrument records as we know them, began in February
1853.

At an early stage in Sir John Lawes agricultural research work, he
realised how important the weather was in the growth of crops,
particularly rainfall, and the effect this had on the leaching of
nutrients from the soil.</p>
<P>
He tried many ways of measuring rainfall before finally settling for a
gauge of one thousandth of an acre. The original gauge was built in
1852, constructed mainly of timber with a lead funnel, and positioned
slightly north of the present one. The rainwater was collected in
carboys and weighed daily to find the amount of rain. This gauge became
weak and in 1873 a new one was constructed on the present site. At the
same time the technique of weighing was replaced by galvanized iron
calibrated cylinders which made the job of rain measurement much
easier.  The gauge itself has seen little change in its long history
other than routine repairs and new collecting tanks as the older ones
rusted away. The current tanks are about four years old and are made of
modern plastics following on from glass, iron and steel ones previously
used. The funnel was completely restored in 1992 to its original
hardwood and lead construction.</p>
<P>
At various times other smaller raingauges were used, both 5 and 8 inch
funnel diameter. In 1948, the present 5 inch diameter gauge was
installed which is now the Meteorological Office standard. In our case
the gauge is surrounded by a turf wall retained by brick; this reduced
wind eddies in our exposed position.</p>
<P>
At Rothamsted we have had a recording raingauge since 1921 which has
always been of the natural syphon type. Rain is collected in a float
chamber and recorded on a daily chart on the clock drum. This has the
capability to record 10mm of rain before syphoning begins and the
recording will then restart at the bottom of the chart. From this we can
derive both rate and time of rainfall. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC15">Rainfall data</A> to
select variables for extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC3">Measuring Percolation</A></H2></p>
<P>
Although Lawes had built the 1/1000th acre raingauge, he still had the
problem of where the excess water was going and what nutrients were
being lost (leached) by drainage. In 1870 the three percolation gauges
(or drain gauges as they are sometimes known) were brought into use.
They consist of undisturbed blocks of soil of 20 inches (51cm), 40
inches (102cm) and 60 inches (152cm) in depth and of area equal to the
raingauge at 1/1000th of an acre.</p>
<P>
The gauges were constructed by digging round and under the block of
soil, placing perforated steel plates underneath at the required depth
and bricking up the sides. The soil inside the gauges remained
undisturbed throughout the construction process. He now had the ability
to not only measure the rainfall, but also to find out how much of the
rain was draining through the soil and, by analysis, how much nutrient
was being lost. The drainage water was also originally measured by
weighing the carboys of collected water, but these too were converted to
calibrated cylinders. All three gauges remain very much as built and are
still in use for their original purpose. The soil has never been deep
cultivated, only the top is kept clear by hand weeding, and they have
never been cropped.  (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC19">Drainage data</A> to select variables for
extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC4">Temperature</A></H2></p>
<P>
Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert began to look at the whole of plant growth.
Many other climatic conditions affect plant growth other than the rain
they had measured until now. Temperature and sunshine give the plant
energy to use the nutrients released by rain and in 1878 they started to
measure the air temperature with thermometers very similar to those we
still use today. Readings were taken of current dry and wet bulb
temperatures to calculate humidity etc, and maximum and minimum
temperature of the day and night. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC11">Air temperature data</A> to
select variables for extraction).</p>
<P>
Later, in the 1920s, it became possible to record soil temperature using
specially adapted thermometers. These were originally set at depths of
4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 inches under grass cover, and 4, 8 and 12 inches
under bare soil. Although we still use the same type of thermometers
today we have "gone metric" and record at depths of 10, 20, 30, 50 and
100cm. All temperatures are now in degrees centigrade, the change from
Fahrenheit taking place in 1970. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC12">Soil temperature data</A> to
select variables for extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC5">Sunshine</A></H2></p>
<P>
Sunshine readings, or more correctly hours of bright sunshine, were
first recorded in 1892 using a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder,
similar to the instrument in use today. The instrument works by
focussing the sun's rays and burning a mark on a card which is then
measured. The cards are specially treated to prevent them catching fire
and are of varying lengths applicable to the time of year; winter,
equinox (used twice a year) and summer. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC20">Sunshine hours, cloud cover and solar radiation</A> to
select this variable for extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC6">Solar Radiation</A></H2></p>
<P>
Solar radiation has been recorded at Rothamsted since 1921 using various
instruments. Presently a Kipp and Zonen pyranometer is used, which is
the world meteorological standard; the signal is recorded on an
integrator and chart recorder. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC20">Sunshine hours, cloud cover and solar radiation</A> to select this
variable for extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC7">Wind</A></H2></p>
<P>
Although wind estimations using the Beaufort scale have always been used
at Rothamsted, it was not until 1944 that an anemometer was installed.
This gives the run of wind per day, for many years measured in miles per
day, but now as kilometers per day at 2m above the ground. We also have
the Dines anemograph to continually measure wind speed and direction.
This was installed in 1978 and replaced an older pressure tube
anemograph dating from 1954. The wind vane is at 42 feet above ground
level. (Go to section <A HREF="metdata_2.html#SEC21">Wind data</A> to select variables for extraction).</p>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="metdata_toc.html#SEC8">Other observations</A></H2></p>
<P>
Many other observations are taken including measuring evaporation from
an open water tank, amount of cloud, state of the ground surface,
visibility, current weather and barometric pressure. A comprehensive
diary is also kept using the Beaufort letter shorthand.</p>
