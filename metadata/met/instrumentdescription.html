	<h2>Rainfall</h2>

	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted:</B> Rainfall has been measured at Rothamsted since
		1853, in various rain gauges. Data is shown here for three, <b>RAIN,
			RAIN5 and RAINL:</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		The variable <B>RAIN </B> was originally recorded in a 5 inch (12.7cm)
		rain gauge built in a garden near the laboratory in 1852. The water
		collected was measured in a graduated cylinder until about 1880. The
		gauge was then moved to the meteorological enclosure. In 1948, a 5
		inch (12.7cm) copper rain gauge of Meteorological Office standard was
		installed within a 0.3 m high, 1.5 m radius turf wall retained by
		brick to reduce wind eddies. Since 2004, when the met station was
		automated, <B>RAIN </B> has been measured by an electronic tipping
		bucket rain gauge of 25.4cm diameter, calibrated to tip at 0.2mm, also
		within the turf wall. The old 5 inch manual copper rain gauge is still
		used to measure precipitation fallen as snow when the tipping bucket
		rain gauge is blocked with snow or ice.
	</p>
	<p>
		The manufacturers of the ARG100 state that the "ARG100 rain gauge
		typically captures over 5% more rainfall than most
		traditionally-shaped cylindrical gauges due to its unique aerodynamic
		shape and reduced evaporation-loss properties". This has found to be
		the case at Rothamsed. A review of the differences in rainfall capture
		between the ARG100 and the manual 5 inch gauge at Rothamsted was
		conducted. Using a double mass curve analysis, annual data from
		1990-2017, and looking at each added year from 2004 (when the ARG100
		was introduced), the overall correction factor is 1.1 or 10%. This
		means that the ARG100 captures 10% more rainfall than the manual 5
		inch gauge. This correction is only applicable to annual and monthly
		totals, and to the variable <b>RAIN</b> at Rothamsted (ie <b>ROTHMET</b>
		only). It is not applicable to <b>RAINL</b> or <b>RAIN5</b>. To
		convert 5 inch data to ARG100 data, multiply by 1.1. To convert ARG100
		data to 5 inch, divide by 1.1. We recommend that when you download
		data that spans both gauges, you multiply the 5 inch data by 1.1.
		Please contact the e-RA curators for more information.
	</p>
	<p>
		The variable <b>RAIN5 </b> was originally recorded in another 5 inch
		(12.7cm) cooper rain gauge, established in 1873. Data was not recorded
		in e-RA after 1987. RAIN and RAINL are two separate gauges, hence the
		values do not exactly agree.
	</p>

	<p>
		Data is available for RAIN from 05/02/1853 - present, except between
		1880-1914. It is recommended that for a complete run of data from a
		standard rain gauge that a composite of RAIN and RAIN5 is used, based
		on RAIN, with data from RAIN5 being used from 1880-1914 only. Please
		contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators</a>
		for this data.
	</p>

	<p>
		The variable <B> RAIN_L</B> measures rain in a gauge of 1/1000th of an
		acre (4.047 sq metres), built in 1852/53. The gauge was constructed of
		timber with a lead funnel. Rain was collected daily in carboys and
		weighed to estimate the amount of rain. In 1873 a new gauge was
		installed and the carboys replaced by galvanized iron calibrated
		cylinders to measure rainfall. The old gauge was replaced by an
		identical new one in 1992. For details of the early history of the
		1/1000th acre rain gauge, see Lawes, Gilbert & Warington, 1881 (J
		Royal Agric Soc <b> 17</b>: 241-279) or contact the <a
			href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators</a>.
	</p>

	<p>From 2004 onwards the calibrated cylinders were replaced by an
		electronic tipping bucket rain gauge (Campbell Scientific, ARG100)
		calibrated to tip with every 0.0025mm of rain. In July 2010 the lead
		lining was stolen and it was replaced by a new stainless steel funnel
		of grade 316 and dimensions 2213mm x 1829mm in February 2011. No
		RAIN_L data was collected for this period.</p>

	<p>Since 2004, when the met station was automated, RAINL may have
		been underestimating rainfall when rain is intense. RAINL should only
		be used in conjunction with the drainage data, which has the same
		surface area (DR20, DR40, DR60). For general daily rainfall data
		please use RAIN. It is recommended that if you use RAINL, RAIN should
		be used as a check.</p>


	<p>
		<b>"Missing values"</b> There are many instances before 2004 when no
		data is shown for RAIN and RAINL. This is because a 'trace' of rain,
		snow, mist, dew or fog was manually recorded. A 'trace' is less than
		0.05mm. For most purposes a missing value can be assumed to be zero.
		However, if you would like further details of traces of rain recorded
		between 1853 and 2003, please contact the <a
			href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Rain duration <B>RDUR</B> has been measured at Rothamsted since 1931.
		It is defined as the number of hours during which rain fell over the
		previous 24 hours, recorded at 0900 GMT each day. Originally it was
		measured by a Negretti and Zamra natural siphon rain recorder. Rain
		was collected in a float chamber and recorded on a daily chart on a
		clock drum, which recorded 10mm of rain before siphoning began and the
		recording restarted at the bottom of the chart. In 1978 this was
		replaced with a Cassella recorder with a diameter of 20.3cm. Since
		2004 it has been measured by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge.

		<B> Woburn: </B> Rainfall (<B>RAIN</B>) was originally measured
		manually using a 5" (12.7cm) copper cylindrical rain gauge. Since
		1999, when the met station was automated, rainfall has been measured
		by an electronic tipping bucket rain gauge of 25.4cm diameter,
		calibrated to tip at 0.2mm (Campbell Scientific, ARG100).

		<B> Brooms Barn: </B> Rainfall (<B>RAIN</B>) was originally measured
		manually using a 5" (12.7cm) copper cylindrical rain gauge. Since
		2004, when the met station was automated, rainfall has been measured

	<h2>Percolation (drainage)</h2>
	<p>
		<B>Measured at Rothamsted only: </B> Three drain gauges (20, 40 and 60
		inches) were constructed at Rothamsted in 1870. They consist of
		undisturbed blocks of soil 20, 40 and 60 inches (51,102 and 152 cm,
		respectively) deep and are equal in area to the rain gauge of 1/1000th
		of an acre.
	</p>

	<p>The gauges were constructed by digging under and around the
		block of soil, placing perforated plates underneath at the required
		depth and bricking up the sides. The soil around the gauges remained
		undisturbed throughout the construction process. Drain water was
		originally measured by weighing the carboys of collected water (as for
		1/1000th of an acre rainfall above), but these too were replaced by
		calibrated cylinders. In 2004 those were replaced by the electronic
		tipping bucket rain gauge. Percolation is the total over the previous
		24 hours, recorded at 0900GMT. All three drain gauges remain as
		originally built. The soil has never been deep cultivated or cropped
		and the top is kept clear by hand weeding.</p>

	<h2>Temperature</h2>

	<p>
		Daily temperature is measured over the 24 hour period 0900 to 0900GMT;
		this is used for the previous day's maximum <b>(TMAX)</b> and the
		current day's minimum temperature<B> (TMIN)</B>. All other
		temperatures are recorded at 0900GMT. Until 1970 all temperatures were
		measured in ºF; since 1972 they have been recorded in ºC. All
		temperatures in e-RA are displayed as ºC.
	</p>

	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> Air temperatures: </b></B> Maximum <B>(TMAX)</B> and minimum <b>
			(TMIN) </b> air temperatures were first recorded in 1878. <B>TMAX</B> was
		recorded using a mercury column thermometer and <b>TMIN </b>using a
		spirit-in-glass with indicator bar minimum thermometer. In 1915 dry <B>(DRYB)</B>
		and wet <B>(WETB)</B> bulb mercury column thermometers were introduced
		to record air temperatures and calculate variables such as relative
		humidity, vapour pressure and dew point. <b>GRSMIN</b>, the minimum
		temperature on grass, was first recorded in 1909 using a
		spirit-in-glass with indicator bar minimum thermometer.
	</p>
	<p>
		On 15th January 2014 <B>WETB </B>was discontinued and replaced by a
		Relative Humidity Sensor (Campbell Scientific, MP100A) to measure
		relative humidity <B>(RELH) </B>and from which vapour pressure <B>(VAP)</B>
		and dew point <B>(DEWP)</B> are now calculated after the method of
		Buck (1981).
	</p>

	<p>
		<B>Soil temperatures</B> are recorded at 0900GMT. They were first
		recorded in the 1930's using specially adapted thermometers. These
		were set at depths of 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 inches (10, 20, 30, 61, and
		122 cm) under grass cover <B>(G10T, G20T, G30T, E30T, E50T and
			E100T) </B>and 4, 8 and 12 inches (10, 20 and 30 cm) under bare soil <B>
			(S10T, S20T and S30T)</B>. <B>G10T, G20T, G30T, S10T and S20T </B>were in
		direct contact with the soil; G30T was discontinued in 1997. The
		thermometers used to measure <B> E30T, E50T, E100T and S30T</B> were
		encased in a glass sheath in a metal tube, so that they could easily
		be removed to read the temperature. The bulb was set in paraffin wax
		to minimize rapid temperature fluctuations when the thermometer was
		removed from the soil.
	</P>
	<P>Since 2004, all temperatures (air and soil) have been recorded
		by thermistors (electronic temperature probes, Campbell Scientific,
		type 107). For measuring soil temperatures, these are buried in the
		soil at the appropriate depth.</p>

		thermometers. Dry <B>(DRYB)</B> and wet<B> (WETB)</B> bulb mercury
		column thermometers were used to record air temperatures and calculate
		variables such as relative humidity, vapour pressure and dew point.
	</P>
	<p>
		On 1st December 2009 <B>WETB </B>was discontinued and replaced by a
		Relative Humidity Sensor (Campbell Scientific, MP100A) to measure

		and dew point <B>(DEWP)</B> are now calculated after the method of
		Lowe (1977).
	</p>

	<P>
		<B>Soil temperatures</B> were first recorded in 1928 using specially
		adapted thermometers. These were set at depths of 1 and 4 feet
		(approx. 30 and 100 cm) under grass cover. 30 cm is shown as <B>E30T</b>,
		1928-1970, 1988 onwards, <b>G30T</b>, 1971-1987; 100cm is shown as <b>E100T</b>,
		1928-1967, 1971 onwards, <b> E122T</b>, 1968-1970. From 1968, soil
		temperatures were also measured at 2 feet (approx.50cm) under grass
		cover. This is shown as <B>E50T</b>, 1971 onwards, <b>E60T</b>,
		1968-1970. Soil temperatures under bare soil were measured at 4 and 8
		inches (10 and 20 cm, <B>S10T and S20T</B>).

	<h2>Sunshine hours</h2>

	<P>
		<B>Rothamsted:</B> Sunshine readings (hours of bright sunshine,<B>
			SUN)</B> over a 24 hour period 00.00-24.00 hrs GMT were first recorded in
		1892 using a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. The sun's rays are
		focused onto a card (treated to prevent it from catching fire) and the
		brown scorch mark on the card is then measured. The cards are of
		varying lengths applicable to the time of year (winter, equinox, and
		summer). Since 2004 sunshine has been calculated using the
		Campbell-Stokes equation from solar radiation measured using a Kipp
		and Zonen thermopile pyranometer.
	</p>

	<P>
		The maximum temperature in the sun, <B>SUNMAX</B>, was recorded
		between 1915 and 1935 using a black bulb in vacuo.
	</p>

	<p>
		<B>Woburn:</B> Since 1999 sunshine (hours of bright sunshine,<B>
			SUN)</B> has been calculated using the Campbell-Stokes equation from
		solar radiation measurements using a Kipp and Zonen thermopile
		pyranometer. Previously it was measured with a sunshine recorder.
	</p>


	<A NAME="SEC5"></a>
	<h2>Solar Radiation</h2>

	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted: </B> Total solar radiation <B>(RAD)</B> over 24-hour
		periods 00.00-24.00 hrs GMT. Measurements have been made since 1921,
		but the earliest recorded data in e-RA are from 1931. There were
		several gaps between 1921 and 1923, probably due to equipment
		malfunction, so these early data have little value. From 1921-1930,
		radiation was calculated in calories/cm<sup>2</sup> but from January
		1931, radiation was expressed in Joules/cm<sup>2</sup>, and these are
		the data that have been included in e-RA. Penman (1974, see key
		references below) stated that 'Apart from periods for instrument
		repairs, solar radiation has been recorded daily at Rothamsted since
		October 1921. The first instrument was a Callendar recorder, purchased
		by the Plant Physiology Department of Imperial College in 1916, and
		run at Rothamsted for the Department from 1921. In 1943 Professor
		Blackman asked Rothamsted to take over the instrument and be
		responsible for all future repairs and replacements. Right up to 1954
		there was great uncertainty about the sensitivity, and as the original
		supplier had ceased to make them the replacement then sought had to be
		found elsewhere: Over the first 30 years the readings were probably
		accurate enough for the use that could be made of them at the time …
		(but are not good enough for present needs) … In 1955 a Moll-type
		solarimeter (Kipp) was installed with a paper chart recording
		potentiometer. As before, daily totals were obtained by planimeter
		integration - a tedious and awkward task - until in 1958 an automatic
		integrator was added with a digital counter set to register directly
		in cal/cm<sup>2</sup> ' (Rothamsted Weather, Rothamsted Report for
		1973, Part 2, 172 - 201).
	</p>
	<p>Radiation figures between 1947 and 1954 were noted by Monteith
		to be 20% higher than would be expected (and the same probably applies
		to earlier data). Thus, data from before 1955 should be treated with
		some caution. A Kipp integrator and recorder was in use from 13th
		November 1975. A (new) Kipp and Zonen integrator was installed in
		1989. In 2004 this was replaced by a Kipp and Zonen thermopile
		pyranometer.</p>

	<p>
		Data from Rothamsted are recorded as J/cm<sup>2</sup>. To convert to
		MJ/m<sup>2</sup> divide by 100. To convert MJ/m<sup>2</sup> to W/m<sup>2</sup>
		multiply by 11.6.
	</p>

	<p>
		<B>Woburn: </B>At Woburn solar radiation <B>(RAD)</B> is measured
		using a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen, CM6B), and are recorded as MJ/m<sup>2</sup>.
	</p>


	<A NAME="SEC6"></a>
	<h2>Wind</h2>


	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted:</B> Wind direction<B> (WDIR) </B>has been measured
		since 1853. Wind direction is shown in e-RA as an angle, going
		clockwise from North. 360 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West.
		The reading 0 (or 000) indicates that there is no wind, ie the
		windspeed is 0 m/s. A WDIR reading of 0 with a windspeed greater than
		0 implies that the WDIR is 360 degrees (North).
	</p>
	<p>
		Wind speed was originally estimated using the Beaufort scale. It is
		shown in e-RA as wind force<B> (WFORCE) </B>from 1915 to 1959. From
		1960 onwards it is shown as wind speed <B>(WINDSP)</B> converted from
		knots to m/s (1 knot = 0.514 m/s).
	</p>

	<p>The Beaufort scale can be adjusted to wind speed using the
		following equation:</p>

	<p>
		V = 1.624 x SQRT (B<sup>3</sup>)
	</p>

	<p>Where V = wind speed in knots, B = Beaufort scale (1 knot =
		0.514 m/s) (Met Office 1982).</p>

	<p>
		Wind direction <B> (WDIR) </B> and wind speed <B>(WINDSP) </B> were
		then measured by wind vane and a cup anemeometer linked to a Munro
		roll chart recorder (model IM175) installed in 1978. From 2004 an
		electronic wind vane (Vector Instruments, W200P) and cup anemometer
		(Vector Instruments, A100LK/2) were installed at a height of 12.8m
		above ground level. The standard height for surface wind measurements
		over open and level terrain is 10m. However, no correction is needed
		for wind speeds measured between 8 and 13m (Met Office, 1982). We
		therefore assume a mid-point height of 10m. From 2004 wind direction
		and speed are calculated as an average over 10 minutes from 8.50 to
		9am
	</p>

	<p>
		Measurements of wind run <B>(WINDRUN)</B> are available from 1946
		onwards, first measured using a cup anemometer with a calibrated meter
		installed at a height of 2m. From 2004 to January 2014 wind run has
		been measured using an electronic cup anemometer (see above). The cup
		anemometer was at a height of 12.8m. This was then corrected to 2m by
		multiplying by 0.78:
	</p>

	<p>Vh/V10 = 0.233+0.656*log10 (h+4.75), where Vh = speed in knots
		at height h, V10 = speed at 10m and h = height in m (Met Office 1982).
	</p>
	<p>Since February 1st 2014 a second cup anemometer (Vector
		Instruments A100LK) installed at a height of 2m has been used to
		measure wind run, so no adjustment for height is now required.</p>


	<p>
		<B>Woburn:</B> Wind speed was originally estimated using the Beaufort
		scale. It is shown in e-RA as wind force <B>(WFORCE)</B> from 1928 to
		1967. From 1968 onwards it is shown as wind speed <B>(WINDSP)</B>
		converted from knots to m/s.
	</p>

	<p>The Beaufort scale can be adjusted to wind speed using the
		following equation:</p>

	<p>
		V = 1.624 x SQRT (B<sup>3</sup>)
	</p>

	<p>Where V = wind speed in knots, B = Beaufort scale (1 knot =
		0.514 m/s). (Met Office 1982).</p>

	<p>From 01/07/1999 onwards wind speed has been measured using an
		automated cup anemometer at 2m height. This sensor was replaced in
		July 2008 with a new cup anemometer (Vector Instruments, A100LK). The
		values in e-RA have been adjusted to the standard height of 10m (Met
		Office, 1982).</p>

	<p>
		Wind run <B>(WINDRUN)</B> was first measured using a cup anemometer
		installed at 2m with a calibrated meter. Since July 1999 it has been
		measured by a cup anemometer at 2m, the same instrument used for
		measuring wind speed (see above).
	</p>

	<p>
		Wind Direction<B> (WDIR)</B> was estimated from a wind vane with fixed
		ordinal points. In 1999 this method was replaced by an electronic wind
		vane ( Vector Instruments, W200P).
	</p>

	<p>
		<B>Brooms Barn:</B> Windspeed is measured at 2m and adjusted to the
		standard height of 10m by multiplying by 1.28. Between 24th May 2012
		and 11th December 2012, windspeed was a 10 minute average, recorded
		between 8.50 and 9.00am. Since 2013 it has been a point value recorded
		at 9.00am.
	</p>

	<p>The Brooms Barn meteorological station is approx. 30m from the
		main buildings, which are approx. 10m high. This may cause some
		interference with the measurement of wind speed and wind direction, as
		ideally a mast with wind sensors should be a minimum of 10 times the
		height of the nearest building away from the nearest building (ie at
		least 100m apart). This gives enough fetch for the wind to settle
		down. The met station and main building have always been in these
		positions.</p>

	<A NAME="SEC7"></a>
	<h2>Evaporation</h2>

	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted:</B> In 1924, a brick-lined pit 8ft (2.44m) and 20ft
		(6.1m), surrounded by 12 cylinders set in the soil was built at the
		Rothamsted meteorological enclosure. The cylinders were 6ft (1.83m)
		deep and 2ft 6in. (0.76m) in diameter and made of cast iron lined with
		a 1/2in. layer of bitumen painted concrete; the bottom of the
		cylinders sloped down to an outlet pipe accessible from the pit. Five
		of the cylinders were filled with a sandy loam from Woburn, the soil
		texture being uniform throughout. Three of the soil cylinders had turf
		laid on top of the soil; the other soil surfaces were kept bare. The
		soil was left to settle and weather for 16 years. Ten cylinders were
		joined up in pairs at the outlets, each soil cylinder being connected
		to an unfilled cylinder, so forming a set of U tubes. Waterproof
		covers were provided for the unfilled cylinders (minors) to prevent
		entry of rain and to reduce evaporation losses to negligible amounts.
		The minors were filled with water until the soil or turf surfaces were
		flooded, then water was run out until the water-table had reached a
		pre-determined depth below the surface. One of the minors was filled
		to near the brim and the level kept at 1 in. below the surface and
		this was selected as the open water standard. For further details
		refer to Penman (1948).
	</p>

	<p>A standard meteorological Office evaporation tank was installed
		in 1945. The galvanized iron tank measured 2ft 6in (0.76m) in diameter
		and was 2ft (0.61m) deep. The water level was kept at or near ground
		level, leaving a projecting rim of 3in (7.62 cm). The level was read
		daily with a hook gauge reading to 1/100 in., and topped or drained as
		necessary.</p>

	<p>
		Evaporation measurements ceased in 1974 and values were instead
		derived from wet and dry bulb temperatures (see <a
			href="Met/derived variables">Derived Variables</a>).
	</p>

	<A NAME="SEC8"></a>
	<h2>Relative Humidity</h2>

	<p>
		Relative Humidity <b>RELH</b> was originally derived from wet and dry
		bulb temperatures. A Relative Humidity Sensor (MP100A, made by
		Rotronics, supplied by Campbell Scientific) replaced the wet bulb
		sensor at Woburn and Brooms Barn in 2009 and at Rothamsted in 2013.
		The MP100A was replaced by an EE181 E+E RH probe, which is made by E+E
		Elektronic Corporation, supplied by Campbell Scientific, at Brooms
		Barn on April 25th, Woburn on July 3rd and Harpenden on August 7th
		2018.
	</p>


	<A NAME="SEC9"></a>
	<h2>Vapour pressure</h2>

	<p>
		<B>Rothamsted:</B> Vapour pressure <B>(VAP)</B> was calculated from
		1946 to January 2014 from Wet Bulb (WETB) and Dry Bulb (DRYB)
		temperature (see <a href="Met/derived variables#VAP">Derived
			Variables</a>). This is calculated in kPa and converted to mb in the e-RA
		output. mb=kPa x 10.
	</p>

	<p>
		On 15th January 2014 <B>WETB </B>was discontinued and replaced by a
		Relative Humidity Sensor (Campbell Scientific, MP100A) to measure
		relative humidity <B>(RELH) </B>. From January 15th 2014 onwards
		Vapour Pressure has been calculated within the datalogger from
		Relative Humidity and Dry Bulb temperature after Buck (1981 - see <a

		<B>Woburn:</B> Vapour pressure <B>(VAP)</B> was calculated from July
		1999 to November 2009 from Wet Bulb (WETB) and Dry Bulb (DRYB)
		temperature (see <a href="Met/derived variables#VAP">Derived
			Variables</a>). This is calculated in kPa and converted to mb in the e-RA
		output. mb=kPa x 10.
	</p>
	<p>
		There were problems with the Wet Bulb thermometer drying out, and data
		from the end of 2009 was unreliable. In December 2009 a Relative
		Humidity sensor was fitted (Campbell Scientific, MP100A) to the
		datalogger and the Wet Bulb thermometer discontinued. From December
		2009 onwards Vapour Pressure has been calculated within the datalogger
		from Relative Humidity and Dry Bulb temperature after Lowe (1977 - see
		<a href="Met/derived variables#VAP">Derived Variables</a>).

	<h2>Barometric pressure</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Rothamsted:</b> Atmospheric pressure was measured with a mercury
		barometer from 1915 to 2003 <b>(BAR)</b>. A thermometer attached to
		the instrument casing (known as the attached thermometer, <b>THERM</b>)
		was used to measure the temperature of the mercury column from which
		the density of the mercury was established. Pressure corrected to mean
		sea level <b>(BAR_MSL)</b> is also available from 1950 to 1977.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Woburn:</b> A mercury barometer was used to measure atmospheric
		pressure from 1928 to 1970, and 1988-1999 <b>(BAR)</b>. A thermometer
		attached to the instrument casing (known as the attached thermometer,
		<b>THERM</b>) was used to measure the temperature of the mercury
		column from which the density of the mercury was established. Pressure
		corrected to mean sea level <b>(BAR_MSL)</b> is also available from
		1928 to 1967.

	<h2>Other variables</h2>

	<p>
		<b>Visual measurements</b> of cloud cover, state of the ground's
		surface, visibility, current weather, etc were collected daily and
		entered into a diary. The codes used are based on Meteorological
		Office Standard weather codes. Visual measurements ceased to be made
		at Woburn in 1999 and at Rothamsted in May 2007. For full details for
		the various codes used, please contact the <a
			href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk"> e-RA Curators</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Cloud cover <b>CLOUD</b> is recorded in Oktas, on a scale of 0 to 9. 0
		represents clear sky, 8 complete cloud cover with 9 representing fog.
	</p>


	<p>
		Other variables were recorded onto Meteorological Office return sheets
		as extra columns. Evaporation, vapour pressure, dew point and
		potential soil moisture deficit are derived from wet and dry bulb
		temperatures (see <a href="Met/derived variables#VAP">Derived
			Variables</a>).
