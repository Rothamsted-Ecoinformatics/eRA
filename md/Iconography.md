# Project Iconography	
The images need to be sorted, renamed, captioned and credited properly. 

 1. Put appropriate images in the appropriate folder
 2. Rename the images using image naming conventions
 3. To make a different framing of an image, make a copy of it, open Scanhandler and reframe the copy. That will reframe it and also make the necessary copies of the image. 
 4. If the names are expressive, the captioning of the image will be made easier. I guess proper captions can be found in the old web site
 5. use the zdevProcessImages to make a csv of the images directory
 6. import in timeline.accdb media table 
 7. use the media tab to caption and describe the images
 8. use a query to export the tab and translate into JSON. 
 9. put the json in the proper place.

We want images for the farms, the experiments, maps, and so on and also images to include in the pages.
