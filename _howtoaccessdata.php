	<div class="row p-3 m-3">
		<p>e-RA provides three levels of access to data from the Rothamsted Long-term Experiments National Capability:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Published aggregated datasets</li>
		<li>Published annual plot datasets and daily met station datasets</li>
		<li>Request only access to the e-RA database</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Published aggregated datasets</h2>
<p>Aggregated datasets provide access to datasets for which annual plot data has been averaged across a number of years or plots such that data values from an individual plot
 in a year cannot be determined. Aggregated datasets provide a simplified or summary overview of an LTE dataset and key findings or changes of an LTE. For meteorological datasets, aggregated datasets average hourly and daily data to monthly or annual values.</p>
<p>Aggregated datasets are published with a citable DOI and are freely available under a CC-BY-4.0 license. Users of these datasets must give appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the dataset must be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research endorses the user or the use. </p>
<p>Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a href="info.php?FileName=conditions">Conditions of Use</a> and must agree to these conditions.</p>
<h2>Published annual plot datasets and daily met station datasets</h2>
<p>Annual plot datasets provide access to observed and measured data values from individual plots for each year data has been collected. Meteorological datasets are provided at daily and hourly resolutions.</p>
<p>To access these datasets we ask you to complete a simple registration form and provide a valid email. We ask you to complete this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It helps us to understand who is using the data and how.</li>
<li>It allows us to report to the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, who fund the Rothamsted Long-term Experiments and this data repository, how the Rothamsted LTEs and data have continuing impact.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also optionally opt in to receive updates for the datasets you use.</p> 
<p>These are curated datasets which are intended to be straightforward to use and readily understood by researchers. However, while the e-RA curators have made every effort to provide sufficient supporting documentation and metadata to allow researchers to independently use these datasets, researchers are still strongly encouraged to contact the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA Data Curators</a> for support. 
<p>The data provided in these datasets may represent a subset of experimental treatments or plots for an LTE. The data included is determined by the LTE data curators based on criteria including:
<ol>
<li>Continuity of experiment treatments.</li>
<li>Importance, relevance and/or comparability of an experiment treatment to other treatments in the LTE.</li>
<li>Popularity based on historical use and requests for research.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data not included in these datasets is accessible from the e-RA database and can be accessed on request.</p>
<p>Annual plot datasets datasets are published with a citable DOI and are freely available under CC-BY-4.0 license. Users of these datasets must give appropriate credit by citing the dataset using the provided citation which includes the DOI. Any reasonable changes made to the datasets must be indicated but not in a way that suggests Rothamsted Research endorses the user or the use.</p>
<p>Before downloading a dataset you should read the <a href="info.php?FileName=conditions">Conditions of Use</a> and must agree to these conditions.</p>
<h2>Request only access to the e-RA database.<h2> 
<p>The e-RA database provides access to additional curated LTE data. The database is accessible online using the password protected e-RA data extraction tool. Normally access will be provided for researchers requesting access to data in specific datasets not included in published datasets. </p>
<p>We do not publish all data for a number of reasons including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plot does not have continuity of treatments over time.</li>
<li>The treatments do not have relevance or comparability to other experiment treatments.<li>
<li>The data is not well enough described or is still in preparation.<li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers are strongly encouraged to seek support from the <a href="mailto:era@rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">e-RA Data Curators</a> to interpret this data.</p>
